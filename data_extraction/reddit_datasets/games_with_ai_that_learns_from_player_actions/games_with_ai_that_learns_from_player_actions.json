    "body": "NN is a solution to a fuzzy problem where information is incomplete but training examples are more abundant.  For example, you could use NN to improve the aim of a particularly bad shooter to make a FPS more fun for a weaker player. You could use a NN to manage a sidekick that tries to fill in for your weaknesses, or one that gets weaker as you get stronger, or finds ammo for you based on your typical firing rate.   As others said, it's not great for opponents except in strategy games as they can get better than you fast, but it might be a great solution to reduce frustration if levels are crazy difficult.  For most game scenarios, AIs are typically more procedural and there's no reason to put a NN on it because a variable with a percentage is usually good enough. Creatures (old game) had some rudimentary AI learning capability. if I recall.\n ",

Although thats just my own theory and I may be 100% wrong so take what im saying with a grain of salt.",
