With chat AI you could expand this significantly.\n\nLook at it this way: Developers already make use of procedural tech when creating large landmasses, however they still determine its general design and they still fill in critical details in main locations. I think chat AI could be used the same way. The writers can focus on writing the main story and main characters, give a decent amount of side characters some dialogue, and let the less important NPC's be handled by a chat AI.\n\nOne example would be a game like Cyberpunk 2077: You have the main and side quests fully handled by the main writing team, but there's tons and tons of NPC's which are basically identical and only say 2-3 lines. Let a chat AI handle those to give it more variety and depth (assuming halfway decent voice synthesis would also be available). In that game it'd even be kind of thematic too :P\n\nChat AI will never replace human writers, but in this way i think it'd add a bit of life to certain kinds of games (mostly large open world rpg's) .
