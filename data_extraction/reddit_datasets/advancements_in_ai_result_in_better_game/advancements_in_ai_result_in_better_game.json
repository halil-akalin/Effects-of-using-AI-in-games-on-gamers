But that's a chat AI.  It's for absorbing words, organizing them, and spitting them back out in coherent sequences to give the illusion of intelligence. It doesn't learn so much as acquire and regurgitate.   It's bacially this generations flying car or moon colony.  Even the OpenAI Ceo knows what I'm saying. He looks at chatAI as fairly crude and simple. \n\nIn order for video game AI to get better, it has to be able to see it's environment (while understanding what it sees), have positional awareness, and anticipate deception. The StarCraft AI project already proved that to be outside the abilities of modern AI. It couldn't get out of gold rank and needed map hacks.  They copied a pro and created a dozen copies of that, then pitted them against one another for like months, then beat the pro.  That's what got written about - not the reality of it's limitations.",

Your comment reminded me of an article, I cannot remember the game, of a FPS game being developed and they wanted to add smarter AI.\n\nSo they programmed some enemies to be able to flank the player. You'd encounter a group of enemies, they'd fire on you, an enemy would yell \"Go flank them!\" and a small group of the enemies will attempt to walk around obstacles or other rooms and flank the player.\n\nWell what ended up happening in playtests was that they got a lot of complaints of \"enemies being able to spontaneously appear behind you without any warning.\" Even though they made sure enemies would be yelling orders to each other to flank the players. They found out players generally would tunnel vision enemies in front of them, and having a smarter AI that could circle around the player was too unfair from a player's perspective.",

If anyone doesn’t know what that is, look it up.\n\nSo, it underscores how and why a conscious artificial general intelligence cannot be created solely algorithmically, without hardware redesign, as modern neuroscience theories such as Integrated Information Theory suggest. But, it also means that *if* we somehow accidentally create a “true AI”, it may be damn hard for us to realize it. Conversely, if someone *deliberately* created one and released it on the world, it may be damn hard to recognize it for the same reason.\n\nSimulated intelligence technology will probably change our world in ways that are difficult to predict right now, and that’s without the inevitable offshoots and advancements that will occur. Saying it is “this generation’s flying car or moon colony” is a huge understatement. As a neurologist, I find this technology to be somewhat scary because it is a great example of what neuroscientists, philosophers of mind and AI researchers have been saying for *decades* now, and I personally didn’t expect it to be culturally adopted so fast.\n\nI think all of us would love a smarter Alexa. It’s what comes afterwards that is potentially problematic, and it is totally up to humans to determine the trajectory that artificial intelligence research goes in. Without being too alarmist, now is the time that we should be thinking about the ethical, cultural and legal ramifications of it - not after the fact. To think that we will do AI research responsibly is hopelessly naive in my opinion. Pretty much all of human history disproves that thought.",
