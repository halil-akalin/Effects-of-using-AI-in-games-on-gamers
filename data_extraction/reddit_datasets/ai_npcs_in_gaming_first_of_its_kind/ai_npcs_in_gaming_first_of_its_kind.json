This would enhance the level of engagement and provide players with more challenging and entertaining gameplay.\r  \n\r  \nAdditionally, the development of more advanced NPCs could also have implications for other fields, such as robotics and automation. AI-controlled NPCs could be used in simulations to train and test autonomous systems in various scenarios, allowing for more efficient and effective learning.\r  \n\r  \nMoreover, the use of AI in NPCs could also have social and ethical implications. As AI becomes more advanced, the line between human and machine becomes blurred, raising questions about the rights and treatment of intelligent beings. This could lead to discussions and debates about the ethical implications of AI and its role in society.\r  \n\r  \nOverall, the integration of AI into NPCs has the potential to revolutionize not only the gaming industry but also other industries and society as a whole.",

NPCs could all come with a randomly generated set of characteristics including a morality scale and whether or not they'd help you. You could lie to them and convince them of things.

    "body": "Yes and no. Large language models are pre-trained on large amounts of data that is correct and you need way more data than even a big development team could ever write on their own. But there is a thing commonly done called fine-tuning, where you take a language model pre-trained on a large corpus of general text and then adapt it to your specific problem where you have a lot less data available. The general idea is that the model keeps grammatical structure that it learned on the original task and then adapts that to your task at hand. The issue is that you do not really have complete control over this fine-tuning, so it can be hard to make the model forget some real world things it learnt previously but should not know, for example you probably do not want your fantasy game city guard to know the life history of trump or have an understanding of astrophysics. But maybe you can get around this by only allowing the player to choose from a given set of questions as is done in current video games instead of giving them complete freedom of what they can say, for example via voice input or via text. Also, you would need to fine-tune such a model for different characters in the game world with different knowledge, for example, a farmer should not have the same understanding of the world that some highly educated wizard has, which can quickly become very expensive. I think all of those problems are solvable, right now those ai's are anyway way to expensive to run on consumer-level GPUs, especially when you also have to render the game world and once we get to a point where it's plausible to run this on consumer-grade hardware, we might have figured out the fine-tuning too.",

We slap some textures on polygons and make them do a bunch of trigonometry and post processing. I see no technical reason we can't bake a lot of that into games so that a lot of the work is more akin to going to a lookup table, instead of raw dogging everything and reprocessing it everytime like we do.\n\nAn example of this is the game roller coaster tycoon. Where the entire game file takes up less data than a single screenshot. Of course it was programed by a madman with assembly, which is like one step from machine code.\n\nNow having a central server is a little problematic in that it will always have a delay.

You as a player most likely will not even interact with 1% of them, but let's say we max out the possible AI controlled population of the whole game at that, so 40 000 agents.\n\nAccording to Steam, GTA5 peaked at [360 000 active players](https://steamcharts.com/app/271590), so that's players playing the game all at the same time - and only on Steam, not counting other stores. Let's be generous and serve the average player count of a 100 000.\n\nNot to break immersion, these agents not only need to interact, but with the help of some optimization *remember* the player if they interact often. Even if the average player meets and interacts with 100 agents, that's already around 100 000 000 agents memory that has to be stored on a central server. And I don't mean storing it for your convenience, but storing it for the AI solution to work when players are playing the game.\n\nAbout the cost of each token, let's say each hour this average number of players are interacting with 50 agents on average (from having 2 lengthy discussions to having a shooting spree frenzy involving 100 agents). That's not a token, just an interaction, and tokens could be a single one, or like in the video above, 5-10, maybe more. Let's average 10 tokens per agent.\n\nAt 500 tokens per 100 thousand players with $0.002, we are looking at a cost of $100.000! And that's an hour!\n\nI don't see a game company spending almost 2 and a half million dollars each day for AI controlled NPC-s on that scale any time soon.",
