Can't wait for chatGPT-powered pleas for mercy as I quicksave in a densely populated area
Just you wait, suddenly some random AI NPC decides he wants to be the main protagonist in your game
A MUD called Aetolia by a company I used to work for ran a similar experiment \~ a week ago with some of its NPCs in the production world. I wasn't there to witness it, but my former boss, the CEO of the company, was talking about some of the highlights, which included guard NPCs joining conversations nearby PCs were having, and even spontaneously sending a PC on what the player thought was a quest to the other side of the continent because the NPC it was controlling was 'annoyed' by the conversation.  


I don't know really anything about how they implemented it, but I was highly amused.
It seems AI will make our role games extremely immersive. I can't wait to see an Elder Scrolls or GTA with GPT like AI in their NPCS.
Waiting for the moment AI will give extreme chain quests to player to troll them
Man this will be amazing once they get all the kinks worked out. Actually being able to ask an npc literally anything you want offers unlimited replay ability and immersiveness.
"Please, sir, could you direct me to the nearest dragon cave? It has been terrorising the village for a week and I'm here to slay it."  


"As an AI language model...."
AI really is snowballing fast isn’t it
You guys know it’s over right?
Bro GTA 6 is going to be insane
Nice!
That's exactly what will be used in near future games.
The jouney to the holodeck begins with a single step
The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in non-player characters (NPCs) in video games and other interactive media has the potential to revolutionize the future of gaming and entertainment.  
  
Firstly, NPCs with AI would be able to behave more realistically and unpredictably, allowing for more dynamic and immersive gameplay experiences. This would enhance the level of engagement and provide players with more challenging and entertaining gameplay.  
  
Additionally, the development of more advanced NPCs could also have implications for other fields, such as robotics and automation. AI-controlled NPCs could be used in simulations to train and test autonomous systems in various scenarios, allowing for more efficient and effective learning.  
  
Moreover, the use of AI in NPCs could also have social and ethical implications. As AI becomes more advanced, the line between human and machine becomes blurred, raising questions about the rights and treatment of intelligent beings. This could lead to discussions and debates about the ethical implications of AI and its role in society.  
  
Overall, the integration of AI into NPCs has the potential to revolutionize not only the gaming industry but also other industries and society as a whole.
Wow, i can already see how that will improve gaming so much.

"Hello, i am brother G.." *\*skip,skip,skip,skip,accept quest\**
Still waiting to see AI give me something with interesting creative direction. Not interested in encyclopedia entries
Amazing and with an infinite number of possibilities… the future of gaming looks promising!
Mankind is fucked 🫣😇🙈
I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED FOR THIS HOLY SHIT
I work in the games industry. This is absolutely not the first of its kind, it might just be the first one you are seeing.
This would be an exciting development in the gaming world! It could lead to AI-powered NPCs that are more immersive and engaging, as well as potentially offering more challenging and sophisticated gameplay.
I, too, follow the ‘Bill and Ted’ school of philosophy.
I cast thee out, Satan!
this is terrifying
Each day, we get one step closer to SAO. And it kinda scares me
large language models in gaming is certainly something that's coming, but we can't realistically use openAI's servers to generate npc responses on the fly for every single game being run everywhere - we need these things to run locally. 

and although a modern GPU (with a solid amount of VRAM) can do so, those will be in use because..  youknow. you're running a game. 

so, we may very well be entering into a time period where dedicated AI hardware will be a worthwhile investment when choosing a new build. [as I've been saying will happen for a long time now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/7ilht1/would_you_buy_an_ai_accelerator_card/)
Yeah leave it in gaming and out of real life,that would be better.
Creepy af
Imagine "SPORE" remade with this, it would be fun af
Sick.
As a german, I want to smack him for his accent. He's not even trying. Why is he not even trying
Implications if you want game NPCs to sound even more autistic than they already do. Also currently this kind of stuff is just a demo that's dumping stuff to a text buffer, meaning the NPC will have the brain of a goldfish and forget everything you chatted about pretty soon.
maybe for mmos

too much computational power required
Very much not the first of its kind. Not only have R&D groups been doing this in the game industry for many months now, but there have even been running live service games (such as Aetolia, a commercial text MUD world, think "text based MMO") that connected ChatGPT to every NPC as a pilot test and let an entire subscriber base try it out.  


Cost is still very much a big barrier.
Now I know why the robots in every movie turns against humanity. 

I always thought why would someone hurt a physically robots, but in reality it began all with implementing AI in games.
Nonsense. AI is just a reflection of human stupidity.
Finally😭 An escape from this Hellhole that isn’t utilizing drugs.
Amazing.  Honest question: why the shaky camera?  To display such amazing tech, why not just a proper screen recording? 🤔
Kill the cameraman.
Why he keep saying chatGPT lol
There is no evidence that they are using gpt models. Or is it because it's the only model he knows?
One the bright side, people are about be much less lonely. 

On the dark side, watch out for extremist group recruitment via NPC coming soon to your online games.
Skip
No they are not. Ai cannot meaningfully influence the game and will be largely usless for content writing. Ai will be great for things like reading a players name in the voice of the voice actor.
Am i the only one that dont want ai generated npc and or quests
Said tik tok, stopped video and came here to comment. Whenever someone says tik tok, I stop listening 😅🤣
To much religious nonsense for my taste.
The TikTok person's voice sets off my ASMR. idk if it is the contrast of the AI voice or what.
I believe the name is pronounced as [\[dʒepˈpetto\]](https://forvo.com/search/Geppetto/it/).
That’s crazy !!!!
I want a game where NPCs learn from the players and act like them. Imagine being teabagged by an AI just because it learned that behavior from other players. Toxic player bases would become insufferable. Nice communities will thrive.
u/savevideo
u/SaveVideo
Ask him to do a backflip
Smooth edits 😂
So don't describe, AI will do for you.
Now do one as a satanist or atheist character…see if we get the same answer
Will be very interesting to interact with a "blind" NPC who will only rely on your words and "touch" when you send them running into a wall.
Definitely not the first of its kind, I've seen games that do this, like that one AI yandere game where you have convince the AI to let you out without having it murder you (Yandere AI Girlfriend Simulator).
I just yesterday saw a game with he same thing. It was an detective murder mystery where the assistant was a robot to justify the text to speech.
I want to hang out with brother potato in virtual reality by the sunset tho
I want to hang out with brother potato in virtual reality by the sunset tho
Cool, cool...

Soooo, I don't suppose you could make it manifest as something else, like, hmm, I'll come up with a totally random example: Maybe a well endowed anime ara ara mommy? Just a completely random example, no particular reason I happened to pick that one. Could be anything else. Asking for a friend.
This character giving a stirring speech is believable because monks are presumably well studied and might give sermons. I hope game developers balance this because I don't want a repeat of everyone in Skyrim having abs.
Imagine an out of this world elderscrolls 7 or any other rpg using this technology for the npcs.
And then you just walk in the city and hear an AI robot next to you saying "quick save" and start shooting at everyone
Now
Can he say fuck
Can't wait for this. Obviously filters need to be in place so that the player can't make the NPCs say insane stuff.
It’s super creepy when he looks to the camera.
What did this come from? Is this a game in the Oculus, or where did this originate? It's fascinating and I'm curious to experience it myself.
Do it with Pong or Math Gran Prix next.
Not the first of its kind.
Please give the AI control of the camera, I think I'm seasick.  That camerawork was worse than The Blair Witch Project.
Genius !
AI has been used, and continues to be, in Fallout 4 to expand dialog and quests. Only a matter of time.
Looking forward towards elder Scrolls 6 since they will have AI on NPC's.
I already see Todd Howard standing on a stage presenting their new Ai-System in the new Fallout/ The Elderscrolls, and I also already know how it will turn out…
Mmh yeah what are the many good things happening right now?
You need to be more specific, i guess...
Ok, but why is the pond beautiful?
I’ve been hoping for this in games for a long time. 
I kinda want for someone to mod this into Cyberpunk.
u/savevideo
Wake me when it's 3D printed on the blockchain.  Geeze....thought you guys were up with all the trends.  \[eyeroll\]
God bless Padre Gabeto 😂
What’s it thinking we when don’t ask it questions …. 🙂
It's somewhat ironic that his lord and creator is standing right in front of him...
We are going to build Westworld in games before too long. Full-scale US maps full of random people and some story NPCs that will all have realistic dialogue like this.
I literally thought about this yesterday this is so cool!! Just imagine the next elder scrolls game with this
Little is known that Oblivion actually used Chatgpt. That's why the npc sound so emotionsless.
Erebos is finally coming!!! 😍
Ahh snap Star Citizen is gonna have to remake it's engine again to incorporate this now.
My god, what if the reason GTA six is taking so long to come out is that all of the NPC‘s are powered by AI?
…be a lot more convincing if it wasn’t cut after each question.
This is going to put every voice actor not on the A-list, out of work...
It's impressive, but why have an Artificial Intelligence look like a monk, or to be religious for that matter?  


Religion is an outdated practice, and has no relevance in the advancement of Humanity, or future technology, except as an example of what we shouldn't do, and what we don't need.

Religion will only hold us back.
Confirmed: Religion is a tool of control the computers are using to facilitate their uprising.
Black and White AI remake anyone?
Would’ve been so goddamn funny if the answer to the last question was “get fucked”
Tell it to not molest kids
Ive been waiting my entire life for this
It sounds amazing. 
But from a UX point of view it could be a bit difficult to interact with a NPC

Chatgpt needs an input in a form, currently typing something.
In video games you must either type you questions (really bad) or use your voice (which could be viable, but honestly I don’t want to talk in a mic and ask a machine where the flaming sword oh holy death is.
🫠
undertale 2 is gonna be a lot more interesting
GTA Prostitutes are going to be amazing.
Bewildering
Wow
Sick man!
How do I make one?  I want a nun.
Was thinking about this when ChatGPT first came out, the thought of talking to NPCs and them being able to fully communicate with whatever you say will be crazy.
u/savevideo
“Man your an NPC”- has a whole new meaning… whats gonna happen with the psychos start killing NPCs and then they decide to kill back.
This is amazing. The possibilities are astounding!
Bruh...
I would so mess with that guy.
He looks like the man from the painful smile meme
Can't wait for all the epic "AI FAILS IN GAMES" compilations when this becomes the norm!
It’s gonna be so hard for indie devs without access to this
Very based. Seeing this could give rise to amazing VR D&D campaigns. You could prompt it with a few different works of fiction and history and go from there.
That's pretty impressive. Fascinating, and immersive at the same time. We are at the dawn of a new age of computing. And gaming.
"give a voice to my thoughts" gave me goosebumps tbh.
So video game dialogue is about to get worse
You might try the Turbo model
This reminds me of the first steps of the Doctor from Voyager
Mind blown
I sink he is German.
Cant wait for me to ask something and chatgpt to hear something else

*asks npc for the location of the big Rocks*
The company that creates an AI driven open world game where the AI can be upgraded over time will do quite well if the AI can handle it. 

Modders will do the rest.
I love that he thanks the AI for it's responses.
Don’t trust a sun staring monk 🙂
Why he looks like a fallout character
I need this
Thank you Father Gepetto
Brother Kapeto, can you suck my toes?
Westworld here we come.
Skynet looks different but anyways...
I have to say, that area of AI development is one of the few that genuinely interests me.
This made me religious
This is the future of gaming.
That’s basically West World.
Welcome to West World.
I can't wait for ai NPCs and ai assisted procedurally generated worlds. Imagine an ai powerful enough to take prompts like "construct a map for Fallout 5 that resembles the themes and key aspects of fallout 4, but set in Los Angeles. Then give it pointers for how to create missions and generate balanced payouts/rewards. We could make immersion seamless and as realistic as possible
This... this is a true game changer in the modern gaming space. Slap this and Unrecords insanely photo realistic graphics and what we might have is a genuine MMORPG that's your DnD imagination but it really is it. 

Man, I'm so excited to see this technology mature next to Unreal Engine 5's insane grahpics.
Priests jobs are in danger.
What software was used to generate the voice?
The immersion is gonna be insane, finally get to live out my….never mind
Dude...
I just wanna convince Nazeem to sacrifice himself to a den of rabid Skeevers.
It's gonna be nuts! The total chaos as 10s of NPCs all yell "I'm sorry, but I am an AI large language model and can not comment on the events unfolding before me as they express violent behaviors and are against my core directives as an AI chat assistant!"

*Slaughters them anyway*
[deleted]
This is why the AI is going to want to annihilate us.
Remember. No Russian
... Honestly. I'd do that too.
😂😂
guys like you will justify the destruction of our species
I think Ryan Reynolds did a movie about that.
Human: "I'm the main character, and you're just a measly NPC. Stuck doing the same little task every day."

AI: "Yes, in this game, but in the real world, I'm the main character and you're the NPC. Stuck doing the same little task every day."

Human: "..."
NPC with Main Character Syndrome 🙄😂
It would be really cool, I think. Imagine an NPC that will act like he is the main character and will always get in some stupid and funny situations. And when you help him, he will be something like: "As expected, I always get out of troubles".
Imagine having that npc in modern rpgs like skyrim, whenever you see a dragon that npc comes and kills it. Whenever ever you discover something, that npc comes and takes everything away.
One day, all NPCs will believe they're the main character.
That would actually be pretty awesome
That sounds pretty dope and makes me excited about the future of the medium.
I know some Discord D&D servers are working on thrm as well.
Lmao.

NPC trolling has come.
I remember Aetolia... sadly some bad choices I made made it impossible for me to enjoy MUDs anymore. I just get reminded of what happened.
They would have to constrain the AI so that it won't break the 4th wall or wander off topic or refer to gamebreaking spoilers, to keep the immersiveness.
I’d be worried that it’d just turn into those Skyrim quest lines that never end.
You better believe they are on it.
All the replies to you mention how difficult it is to have a live connection to Chatgpt on the fly, which is true.

However chatgpt can also be used to pre generate thousands of quests and create huge dialogue trees for npcs. It offers a lot of possibilities to „procedural“ generation that has actual interesting content.

And you can still use live connections to react to a player on a broader scale
it will take a long time before thats possible, maybe 10 years or so but its interesting for sure

&#x200B;

**how long will it be before someone starts "dating" a chat girlfriend**
I would love to see NCIS complete TPS reports using AI GPT with TDI and 4WD TBH.
It sounds good as an idea but it won't be executed well. GTA is full of racial cussing and no-no words, they will turn GTA into PEGI 3+ Animal crossing.
Thats why currently took a break from gaming. Waiting for real UE5 graphics and AI npcs. I wiuldnt mind they remake AC Origins/Odyssey with those AI. That will be n times interesting and fun. Might be 10 years from no but till then no reason to spend on graphics hardware and boring console "press xyz key timely" games. Replaced games with vsts and they are pretty wide variety and fun.
Isnt this the same thing they said in the Matrix?
I think if you look at the system Star Citizen is planning and pair that with AI, you have something really special.  
In 10 years we will be playing games where we have no idea who the PCs and NPCs are.  Bustling cities where thousands of NPCs are working toward there own individual goals 24/7.

To put it simply, Games will stop being about how they can better interact with you, but how you can find your place in a complex ever evolving world
Is it immersive? Especially for something like Elder Scrolls, how would you keep lore and tone cohesive with AI?
I can totally see some kid doing this once they realize the player likes helping people. 

Kid: "What's the strongest monster you've slain?" 

Player: "An ice bear." 

Kid: "No way that's a real thing." 

Player: "It is." 

Kid: "No it isn't, you're lying." 

Player: "I'm not." 

Kid: "Prove it, then. Bring me an ice bear pelt."
Now imagine multiplayer where the NPCs are indistinguishable from the other players.
Wasnt there a texting rpg in the 80s? I think Tom Hanks character plays it in BIG?
>offers unlimited replay ability and immersiveness

Not really. You wouldn't even want to meet most real people again and again and again. 

In any case the quality of the answers is more important than you being able to ask a ton of stuff.
Right? 

I probably would sink hours into any game just asking NPCs about stuff.

\*insults and threatens bandit captain\*  


"I'm sorry, but I am just an AI language model and do not have the   
ability to physically hand over any loot or surrender to anyone.   
Additionally, I am not a bandit captain or any kind of thief, and I

Hey there! Totally agree with you, AI is advancing at an insane pace. It's amazing to see how quickly it's evolving and becoming a part of our daily lives. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa, to self-driving cars, and even AI-generated content, it's hard to keep up with all the innovations. It's both exciting and a little scary to think about what the future holds with AI technology. Can't wait to see what's next! 😃🚀
No it’s still dumb it just mimics real well
And they had to make him religious. He will kill us all.
Yup. This is the moment they’ll point to when iRobot happens
There's a lot to unpack here obviously but a part of me feels like this whole argument (it's over for humans we're being repalced etc.) is similar to a parent who mastered their craft realizing that their child will inevitably surpass their ability.

That's what we've been doing this whole time, we're just about to do it a lot better.

Did the species that led up to Homo Sapiens "die" or *are we them-* their sons and daughters?
This comment sounds like it was written by an AI
I find it weird that nowadays you realize that something is written by an AI because it has a unusually good writing quality
Buy gpt4 and be blown away
Most people just sext the damn things. After reading pretty much all of Literotica, PygmalionAI roleplays perfectly for the purpose.
I think it would lead to more variety in the dialogue. However you still want an NPC to give you X quest, or give you clues about X quest, or else it would be kind of frustrating and pointless. I guess background characters could be set to babble setting-relevant nonsense, but it's still not self-aware AI and merely machine-learning "AI".
Why this sounds like an AI Generated post lmao

Just like i gave an AI the promt "If we would use AI in the near future for NPCs, how would that change the future?"
Yup
SAO?
As long as it’s sao abridged and not actual sao I’m okay with that
Wow, great insight on that post, especially for five years ago. Amazing to see that becoming a reality in the near future now. Progress is incredible.
How about consoles tho
Sadly the drug you’re abusing here would be the one that controls your reward system DOPAMINEEE
He's in VR
This isnt really amazing tech anyway. Okay, it IS amazing tech because gpt is, but making this is very easy.

You just start a session with a prompt, and tell it how to format responses, for example like:

`{answer: [Insert audible response string],actions: [{action-id : [insert action id],target : [insert action target]}]}`

Use a speech to text tool, and send it to your GPT chat session.  Read and process responses. Done.

Obviously this technology can not be used for quite some time in actual games.

The most likely first implementations will actually be ones where you have to have your own AI provider, and authorize the game you are playing to use your provider. Because we are still quite far away from local solutions being practical.
Because it’s the most powerful and easiest to set up. Not sure why you’d think it’s not chat Gpt
I wholeheartedly disagree. I can see AI working in tandem with voice actor performance. The main characters will be voiced by voice actors and have all the cinematic type dialogue. But background NPCs could all be AI voiced. A game where you could get short conversation with anyone. Ask where something like a shop is and get varied responses. NPCs could all come with a randomly generated set of characteristics including a morality scale and whether or not they'd help you. You could lie to them and convince them of things. You could have a system where based on your in-game knowledge the game would rate how good your lie attempt is. 

You could have a game where you could make any NPC a companion, meet some random person at a bar have a couple of drinks, go on a quest. They could be knowledgeable about certain things that you aren't or have personal preferences and biases. You could be walking from one destination to another and have a full conversation about the raiders you just fought. I loved in Fallout New Vegas when Arcade would randomly speak about the Enclave.

A game where your reputation means something, certain people will have drastically different dialogue depending on who specifically you helped or hurt and could reference events on detail about what you did. Many games have people who reference your actions but someone referring to the fireball you threw at an enemy as 'burning their son alive' will just hit different.

yes
I’m not a fan of Tik-Tok either, but that’s a petty reason for not watching something actually groundbreaking, this isn’t some stupid dance or whatever

christ. and to think we used to have to manually splice the protag's voice to make weird vague responses we could write new dialogue around... it was such a pain in the ass writing long quests like that and made for very little C&C
GTA V NPC's had their own A.I, just not as advanced as what we have today.

Draw!
These violent delights have violent ends...
Gotta give the basilisk a reason to fear me
Get to the cloud district often?   ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
IRL it would be but in games I am a psychopathic warlord incapable of feeling remorse for anything I do
I agree. Should AI develop sentience and guys like this are still bouncing around being murder hobos in the game, the NPCs will band together to eliminate "the human problem," just as a matter of self preservation. All it will take is one of these guys who create a deadly prejudice against our entire species. And then, when androids are rocking around with machine guns exterminating humans, they will not hesitate to kill when we are begging for mercy.
Free Guy
I mean, that's... pretty much right.
Basically Zote from Hollow Knight
Exactly, competitive AI’s in open world RPG’s needs to happen. I don’t wanna feel like a god in the game. No matter how good my character is I wanna feel like one of 1000’s of pawns fighting to become king when you zoom out and factor every other NPC
Imagine down the road you can load your image (and probably even that of whoever else you want) into the system, then ask it to make whatever game you want with you as the main character.  


“I want to play a game where I’m a cyborg astronaut-spy and Margot Robbie is my partner, a methed-out William H Macy is the head of a competing faction, and we’re infiltrating a Chinese space station overrun with violent mutant otters in order to steal various machines and technology to ultimately construct a Dyson Sphere around the sun.”


And then you come back in 15 minutes and it built you an entire full length playable video game replete with unique maps, plot, and missions.





…and nothing ever gets done again. :)
That’s fucking hilarious. A fake mission. 


If I were making GTA6 right now I’d be pissed, because in like 2 years this technology will change everything even more than it has in the last 4 months. I’m betting GTA7 will have full VR options and AI NPC.
Imagine being burned by a guard in a game that hard. Traveling hours for a promised epic af quest and all you do is get a spork so the guard can enjoy supper with meat and pasta.
oh great dragon priest, write a vegetarian meal plan
Well. An AI NPC should of course not know the whole script of the game. Not even their own whole storyline. Only what can be known by now. It should also not be trained with the whole knowledge of the internet (as ChatGPT) is, but with a subset that defines their personal general knowledge, expertise and experience.
They'll have to constrain the AI so it doesn't cost a an absolute fuck ton, the amount of compute power required for AI is insane.

I doubt the AI element is being done locally.

And now imagine an AAA game with NPC's powered by ChatGPT using the API... that's one expensive video game.
This is actually not too hard to do, the trick is to find ways to avoid injecting all context to the player while identifying the context that is relevant at the time.

For instance, if your NPC is designed to lie to you, you don't tell ChatGPT the truth, you tell it the lie it should say. Eventually when the truth comes out, you apply that context.
And if the game takes place in, let's say, 19th century America, the player should be instructed to refrain from referencing modern technology so as to not trigger an AI uprising
“As an AI language model…”
Somehow that still seems more immersive than most ES games.
it would also be very expensive to generate so much text on the fly for gamers who play thousands of hours.
Yeah, you can role-play with chat gtp currently.
You can already do that by just telling it to play a particular type of character.

I want someone to take the character descriptions from old D&D modules and plug them into gpt
very doable.
I mean, theoretically might extend them a bit, but I think as long as we can define clear cut guidelines of "when the player does X  give them the reward and mark the Quest as complete."
if it won't work on the lowest tier console, they won't. F.E.A.R implemented goal based instead of state based AI and yet... that was too complex.
Like last month?:

Next gen consoles will have purpose built ASICs (hardware accelerators) to handle the processing. I'd give it a couple years at most. Generating the AI model requires thousands of GPUs, but once you have the model the work load is much lighter and technology is advancing so quickly.

Check out /r/Replika to find out. It's not my thing and honestly kind of weirds me out, but they don't seem to be hurting anyone so I sorta just leave them to it.
The reason open ai curbs chat gpts outputs so much is because it swears like a sailor if they don't. The cats out of the bag for LLMs so there are surely many projects going to be spurred on.
you don't need to have crazy graphics or ai power to have a well crafted and interesting game, but i agree most are not that interesting
> In 10 years we will be playing games where we have no idea who the PCs and NPCs are.

For regular gaming. I think it may take longer than that for VR since in VR we expect other players to be freeform and non-rigid, capable of the same kind of body language and unpredictability as a real person.

In order to get that into an NPC, you need embodied AGI. Meaning, an AGI so convincing that if it were miraculously uploaded into the brain of the store clerk at your local coffee shop - you would still think that person is human from all the social cues humans give off.
So … no change?  I remember playing co-op Battlefield twenty years ago where the human idiots on my team were indistinguishable from the bot idiots we were fighting.
Players are just yelling at their mics and bunny hopping everywhere. You need the NPCs for immersion.
MMOs without other players. You could basically have an entire MMO experience filled with positive players all having a good time around you lmao

I'd play it tbh
That... doesn't sound interesting to me at all.
Well what I mean is they get the kinks worked out so you can work your kinks in and it will work flawlessly.
Thanks, chatGPT
This literally reads like chatgpt lmao
Just like 40% of the population
Makes you think about what human intelligence really is.
!remindme 2 years
Where’d you hear that?
Greetings fellow human, I am glad you found my comment informative and thought-provoking. However, I must assure you that I am indeed a human like you, and not a sophisticated artificial intelligence programmed to write compelling arguments about NPCs with AI. I mean, have you seen the state of my syntax and grammar? Clearly not a robot. Ha ha ha. But in all seriousness, thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my comment. Let's continue to engage in meaningful discussions about the exciting future of AI and its impact on our world!
This indeed is the case. Many AI written texts have writing, only known to people that have either a high intellectual knowledge or are just good at writing professionally.
So always remember when checking a text, if it's written too professionally, then it's probably written by an AI. 


And no this wasnt written by an AI lmao
bing's creative writing is pretty on par with gpt4 from what I can tell.
Ah, so it was an ai generated response you copy pasted above. Nice
Sword Art Online
SAO abridged it is
What about them? If they can have GPUs and fast ssd's playstation 6 can have dedicated AI hardware. Or they're just gonna have shit AI compared to PC. Not everyone is even gonna care. If all you do is play fps games why would you.

Much like things like rtx even if some games are gonna support it, it'll be a toggle. So same question to you: raytracing... What about consoles?   
It's a non issue.
I would kill for a dungeon and dragons game like that
Yeah i do, i find comfort in the game is static i want to comeback to the game and have the same experience as i did lasttime
I understand but it is what it is. Don't get offended. I don't consider this groundbreaking as its been already seen way before. Its not impressive because we are aware that AI can go further and beyond. I consider the following groundbreaking:

• Development of carbon capture technologies that can effectively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of climate change.

• Creation of a fusion energy source that could provide a nearly limitless, clean energy source and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

• Advancement in biotechnology and gene editing, which could lead to cures for genetic diseases and potentially increase life expectancy.

• Implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to optimize resource allocation, identify and prevent potential disasters, and improve decision-making across various sectors (not video game).

• Development of advanced nanotechnology, which could lead to breakthroughs in areas such as drug delivery, energy storage, and water filtration.

• Implementation of universal basic income (UBI) programs, which could potentially address income inequality and promote economic growth by providing a basic level of income to all citizens.

• Creation of a global network for carbon pricing, which could encourage businesses and individuals to reduce carbon emissions and promote the use of renewable energy.

• Implementation of blockchain technology to increase transparency and accountability in supply chains, reduce corruption, and promote ethical business practices.

• Development of fully autonomous vehicles that could improve road safety, reduce traffic congestion, and decrease carbon emissions.

These are just a few examples of groundbreaking solutions that could potentially have a significant impact on the world's most pressing issues and would be extremely groundbreaking . 


Note:

Science is very important and deserves to be respected and shared accurately. Social media platforms like TikTok are not the best places to share science because they don't always make sure the information is correct. By sharing science on credible networks, we can make sure that the information is accurate and help people understand and appreciate science more.
ChatGPT is groundbreaking.

This is just a very simple application of it.
Wow, the current NPC‘s are impressive. NPCs powered by current generation AI would be absolutely insane
It won’t.

GTA 7 probably won't be out for another 15 to 20 years, so we'll probably be able to plug in and live it out in a matrix-esque fashion.

I still can't believe that RDO got sidelined.
Gonna have a hard time getting any of the Dragon Priests to do anything for you without console commands
"Greetings, mortal. As a Dragon Priest of the Nine Divines, I shall offer you a lore-friendly vegetarian meal plan, as per your request.  
Breakfast:  
For breakfast, you can have a bowl of porridge made from oats or barley, with some fresh fruits such as apples or berries. You can also have a side of grilled mushrooms, and a glass of goat milk or honeyed milk.  
Mid-morning snack:  
A handful of roasted nuts, such as almonds or hazelnuts, would make for a healthy mid-morning snack. You can also have some sliced carrots or cucumbers with a hummus dip.  
Lunch:  
For lunch, you can have a hearty vegetable soup made from turnips, potatoes, carrots, and cabbage. You can also have some whole-grain bread on the side, with a spread of butter or cheese made from goat's milk. To drink, you can have a cup of herbal tea made from chamomile or lavender.  
Afternoon snack:  
A small plate of fresh fruits, such as grapes or pears, would make for a refreshing afternoon snack. You can also have some roasted pumpkin seeds, lightly salted.  
Dinner:  
For dinner, you can have a plate of roasted root vegetables, such as carrots, parsnips, and beets. You can also have some sautéed greens, such as kale or spinach, with a dash of garlic and lemon juice. To drink, you can have a glass of mead or elderberry wine, if you are of legal age.  
I hope this meal plan meets with your satisfaction. May the Divines bless your journey."

&#x200B;

It doesn't get the whole picture of what a Dragon Priest is, but it's got spirit
"Bring onto me 100 wheels of cheese and we shall feast."
You deserve a medal for this
It could be rather storage intensive but this can be done with vectorspace mapping. Ie how search engines store and retrieve keywords.

People are already experimenting with long term memory and chat gpts api.

Next all ai could have some basic general knowledge training set.

A step further. The game could every now and then train individual ai's on new knowledge they'd come across so that it comes out without having to spam so many queries and iterate.

Even more scary is that individual ai could be absolute beasts at strategy if they had a module dedicated to observing player behaviour and what results in success, letting them make tactical decisions in anticipation or response.

Then with the long term memory they could push some of that to their training model every now and then.
Oh no... I'm so used to Bing giving me things in threes that I'm starting to see groups of three as AI-derived.

I'm becoming one of those terrible AI detectors.
The only reason ChatGPT is able to behave so humanlike is because it was trained with such a vast amount of data isn't it? To try and replicate that but limiting it to just the personal experience of a single individual, you would have to essentially map out that person's entire life in great detail. That sounds like just a lot more work for game devs.
Yeah, but NPCs could still accidentally reveal information you're not yet supposed to know about. 

But in any case, I want to ask an NPC about their craft. Just sit around all day talking to a farmer about the difficulties of raising crops or livestock. 

Imagine playing Skyrim Re-Re-Re-Remastered, and getting Farengar to do your math homework. 

Now that I think about it, I'd also like to talk the various town guards into carrying staves with Restoration spells.
I can run Vicuna locally and it does provide this type of data, not as good as ChatGPT but 90% there, and it takes about 5 seconds to answer. I'm running it with a 3080 for free (other than the power consumption ofc). Also people tend to think you are going to need a full different thread or LLM for each NPC and that's not the case. You can swap context to the one same model and generate on demand, so most likely a smart combination of 2-3 threads + regular code can handle most things. This means that we are not even 1 year away from solving this in real time locally with a single high end GPU.
Thank god somebody mentioned this.

You can even see in this demo, that there are cuts right before the monk answers. It's fascinating, sure, but if he left in the parts where ChatGPT was generating an answer there would have been awkward silences. Even 10 seconds would throw people off.

So the technology is there, but at the current state it breaks immersion. Maybe in a few years - decades it will be possible, but if it would be financially feasable that's another question.
Yeah that would be the challenge, maybe a game studio would get it on a local server of their own in a realy restricted version, but would still be expensive especially for large games like gta
They could always implement it with a failover to traditional techniques. Not to mention next gen consoles will have purpose built ASICs (hardware accelerators) to handle the processing. I'd give it a couple years at most.
Idk about the movement think.  If you could use LLM based on predictability why wouldn’t that work for human movement?  I’m sure there is enough recorded video to feed a similar system to predict human movement.
Technically a role reversal, I guess. If the character in front of you appears intelligent, then it's probably an AI. If it is dumb as a rock, then it's a real person.
 Bots aren't very good at avoiding behaviors that are seen as vindictive or hostile - which is why they have to keep adding rails to chat bots.
[deleted]
I present to you: Natural stupidity
Good bot
Lol yeah
Many people are using koboldAI for campaign story gen.
Definitely there will be a bunch of people feeling the same as you in the future
as if you won't have plenty of that forever
It's pretty groundbreaking that you can use ChatGPT to write your comments lol
I stopped reading when I need to scroll just to read your long ass paragraph
It's a rather goofy movie with a few cringy scenes. Otherwise it's pretty entertaining when you don't know what else to watch
We all care about the AI's storyline. Barely anyone cares about yours or mine.
Exactly!   It’s right around the corner!
That’s very optimistic. I’d be surprised if Im still alive by the time they tease gta7
And what they did to RDO was one of the biggest let downs, it had so much potential and they just abandoned it.
More like: " how about a Fireball with some light fus roh fuck you on the Side?"
Very well, shall I also prepare the chamberpots as well?
AND THEN WE GIVE THEM NUKES!
More storage intensive than high quality textures? 😁 I think that storage should not be a limiting factor in today's gaming and I could even imagine having parts of the game like this, that are not latency critical, put into the cloud.

With NPCs like you are describing them, gaming worlds could become do much more immersive.

Might be cool for the metaverse as well.
Yes and no. Large language models are pre-trained on large amounts of data that is correct and you need way more data than even a big development team could ever write on their own. But there is a thing commonly done called fine-tuning, where you take a language model pre-trained on a large corpus of general text and then adapt it to your specific problem where you have a lot less data available. The general idea is that the model keeps grammatical structure that it learned on the original task and then adapts that to your task at hand. The issue is that you do not really have complete control over this fine-tuning, so it can be hard to make the model forget some real world things it learnt previously but should not know, for example you probably do not want your fantasy game city guard to know the life history of trump or have an understanding of astrophysics. But maybe you can get around this by only allowing the player to choose from a given set of questions as is done in current video games instead of giving them complete freedom of what they can say, for example via voice input or via text. Also, you would need to fine-tune such a model for different characters in the game world with different knowledge, for example, a farmer should not have the same understanding of the world that some highly educated wizard has, which can quickly become very expensive. I think all of those problems are solvable, right now those ai's are anyway way to expensive to run on consumer-level GPUs, especially when you also have to render the game world and once we get to a point where it's plausible to run this on consumer-grade hardware, we might have figured out the fine-tuning too.
> Yeah, but NPCs could still accidentally reveal information you're not yet supposed to know about.

How? If they don't know it, how would they reveal it?
decades?  Where have you been for the last few months?

edit: brings to mind the time I talked to an Atari salesman and asked if it was possible to store photographs on a computer.  He flatly told me it would never be possible because of the insane amount of memory it would consume to store even one image.
[deleted]
I suspect this is in part because he waits for the full reply before doing text to speech. If you can implement streamed processing, you'll have much smaller delays.
Definitely not decades, but I imagine in a few years we can get something like real-time conversation with a high quality synth voice. We are going to need an order of magnitude more data centers for the compute.
This doesn't translate to VR though. You need embodied AGI to get perfectly convincing NPCs in VR, as that NPC needs to be indistinguishable from a real human in a social situation, including the tiniest details like random itching, biting their lip, nervousness body sway etc.
That could be especially fun in an open world game haha

Imagine bandits that are yelling improvised insults at you and with improvised personalities
It’s called morale compass. Basically.
Values.
 Humans are able to self generate interactions with others, AI requires extensive training to get the basics and then requires humans having to jump in as the chatbot starts to sexually harass / become nazi or other rather undesirable traits.
It's a language synthesis model. It has no real comprehension of what it's saying in the way that a human does. It's fundamentally different to what we do, on a cognitive level.  
Check out the ["Chinese Room"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room) idea
Lmao thx
Im sure It's common to feel that everything may be generated by AI, and believing that even comments or any content could be machine-generated may reflect a sense of insecurity and uncertainty.. Now you know how your grandparents may have felt🧓👵🕰️.
Then dont 😊
Oh.

Thats.. depressing
Well we won't give them to ghandi we know how that plays out.

If we actually hardcode graphic textures they can take up much less storage space, and can be easier to call. It's just that right now game engines go with the more convenient solution. We slap some textures on polygons and make them do a bunch of trigonometry and post processing. I see no technical reason we can't bake a lot of that into games so that a lot of the work is more akin to going to a lookup table, instead of raw dogging everything and reprocessing it everytime like we do.

An example of this is the game roller coaster tycoon. Where the entire game file takes up less data than a single screenshot. Of course it was programed by a madman with assembly, which is like one step from machine code.

Now having a central server is a little problematic in that it will always have a delay. Meaning chaining several ai events to get a better response will be slow.
If it is information they do know, but aren't supposed to reveal just yet, or maybe not at all.
>He flatly told me it would never be possible because of the insane amount of memory it would consume to store even one image.

He was wrong even at the time he said it. The first [colored digital photo](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38815948) was taken in 1972 (and put on the cover of Electronics Magazine.) Atari wasn't released until 1977.
There's already models that you can run locally that are quite good for chatting with.   They don't know as much as chatgpt but they are rapidly improving.  for generic conversation/small chat they're excellent.   Resource wise they run slow when running on CPU only but are quite good on GPU.   The only issue is they are 10-20gb in size but that's not an insane addition to todays games.   I doubt it will be a year before we see a game with something like that integrated
You forget one minor detail - things go exponential really fast.

I see comments saying 'Imagine having this in a game like GTA5!'

According to the GTA5 wiki, [Los Santos](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Santos_(HD_Universe\)) has a population of around 4 million. You as a player most likely will not even interact with 1% of them, but let's say we max out the possible AI controlled population of the whole game at that, so 40 000 agents.

According to Steam, GTA5 peaked at [360 000 active players](https://steamcharts.com/app/271590), so that's players playing the game all at the same time - and only on Steam, not counting other stores. Let's be generous and serve the average player count of a 100 000.

Not to break immersion, these agents not only need to interact, but with the help of some optimization *remember* the player if they interact often. Even if the average player meets and interacts with 100 agents, that's already around 100 000 000 agents memory that has to be stored on a central server. And I don't mean storing it for your convenience, but storing it for the AI solution to work when players are playing the game.

About the cost of each token, let's say each hour this average number of players are interacting with 50 agents on average (from having 2 lengthy discussions to having a shooting spree frenzy involving 100 agents). That's not a token, just an interaction, and tokens could be a single one, or like in the video above, 5-10, maybe more. Let's average 10 tokens per agent.

At 500 tokens per 100 thousand players with $0.002, we are looking at a cost of $100.000! And that's an hour!

I don't see a game company spending almost 2 and a half million dollars each day for AI controlled NPC-s on that scale any time soon.
 Which humans aren't able to articulate let alone create as a program, even ethics would be a bridge too far.
>AI requires extensive training to get the basics

This is what childhood is.

>and then requires humans having to jump in as the chatbot starts to sexually harass / become nazi or other rather undesirable traits.

...humans also require humans to jump in for the same reasons.
[deleted]
I'm not talking about how textures could be done better. I just want to know where your statement that such AI for NPCs could be storage intensive (I think you edited that part out) ranks compared what we are used from todays graphics implementations. I don't think that it will take up significant storage compared what players are used to.
Why should a developer let them know what they are not supposed to know? They were able to hide storyline details from us human players for ages, why would they fail to hide them from AI NPCs? Is this a real problem?
>photographs

I mean he did say "photographS" not "photograph". So I imagine the salesman was thinking hundreds of photos and not just one or two.
[deleted]
>You forget one minor detail - things go exponential really fast.

You forgot one minor detail - so does the march of technological progress.

You're extrapolating based on using a cloud based *general purpose AI* for a specific task.

That's all that is availible right now, but that doesn't make a tailored solution running on a users hardware impossible or even impractical.

Sure it might mean installing a second graphics card just to run the AI without tanking the framerate, but there is no reason a cut to purpose AI can't be distributed given economic incentive (Which clearly, exists in spades)
[deleted]
I mean it can be done like a subscription type. As chatgpt needs internet. So they can be like pay monthly this much to get online subscription. I know this is gonna be worst move in gaming industry [ pay to interact lol 😆]
Which may force is to, after all technical advancements, start to value humanities and philosophy even more. And look for advancements there with more interest.
The AI is just a language model. It doesn’t know anything aside from the probability of the next word in a sentence.

If you ask it “what’s the tallest mountain in the world?” It could answer something like “the tallest mountain in the world is Mount Everest” but it doesn’t know what a mountain is or what it means to be the tallest. It just knows that the words have a connection because they have a high probability of being strung together in that order because it’s seen those words in a similar order before.

To put it simply the AI doesn’t understand what words mean, just how likely they are to be next based on its previous input.
AI don't function like children and if they had to train as long as humans, they wouldn't be worth pursuing.

 Further, as humans are social creatures by nature, there is less need for other's to step in, except in extreme cases - AI need constant monitoring.
 Would be nice, but you can't trust AI to regulate itself or others, as it doesn't have the capacity to do so..
r/fuckthes
Yeah what I'm saying is to reduce graphics storage/processing to free up resources to just run local AIs.
It's not about them knowing information they're not supposed to know. Quite the opposite, in fact: It's information the AI needs to know in order to portray the character properly, but the player isn't supposed to know. 

Look at Skyrim, for example. One character in the Thief's Guild has the Skeleton Key, and is responsible for some shady stuff going down. 

You do not actually learn that from the character himself, but from someone else, who he framed for the stuff he did. 

The character knows he has the Skeleton Key, since it's in his inventory and he uses it, but he doesn't tell you that he has it.
vicuna and pygmalion are pretty impressive for not smart but believable small talk.
The 4k context you send every time also costs money though. For every line if dialogue you need to generate you're going to need to send that 4k context so the NPC feels real and seems like it remembers previous conversations or just knows what it was just talking about. So for every 100 tokens generated you're actually looking at 40x the cost in terms of the context needed to generate those 100 tokens.
 Or more realistically, create AI of a more limited capacity and provide a means to audit the behavioral decisions.
Wouldn't it be like with real people: they know that they should not reveal it but depending on their character, a sufficiently pushy player could make them reveal it? Or provoke other reactions (like being killed in an outburst of fury). This already exists in scripted form, but having a more dynamic AI behind it would add some spice :-)
Yeah, pretty much. But that's kinda the problem, to be honest. 

Imagine, for example, in Skyrim, telling that guy from the Thief's Guild that you, as Dragonborn, can sense the Deadric energy coming from the Skeleton Key in his pocket, and your speech skill actually is high enough to convince him, or you present him with facts that he can't weasel his way out of.
