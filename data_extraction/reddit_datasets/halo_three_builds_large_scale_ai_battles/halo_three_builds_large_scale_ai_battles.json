Amazing campaign with great gameplay, cinematic+interactive storytelling, the beautiful music that I still listen to in my car from time to time, perfect couch co-op, unlimited amounts of fun for online matchmaking for both competitive and casual, custom games that benefited big time from the creativity generated within Forge mode, and then the theater mode where you could go back and review all your shit.  Hell I got into filmmaking more seriously because of making machinimas with my friends using Halo 3.  It never felt like a dry experience.  You could play Halo 3 in any way and still have a blast.\n\n11 years later and Halo 5 removed couch co-op which essentially kills a lot of the essence that was Halo.  I think studios have forgotten what made gaming great and should really go back and revisit Halo 3 to find out why it lasted for so long on the shelves as everyones must have video game.\n\nEDIT:\nwatch this if you need more reasons why https://youtu.be/8aFMpmTv3lA",

As stated in the video a couple years back I did a video on [Halo 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NU717sd8oUc) (which sadly hasn't aged terribly well), but this gave me a nice opportunity to return to the series (though I did manage to spell Max Dyckhoff's name wrong - sorry!).  I was pleasantly surprised by how well Halo 3 holds up having not played it again since I first bought the Master Chief Collection a few years back.\n\nWhether I can return to Halo in the future I'm not sure - I only make videos when I can be 100% confident in how the AI works in a given game.  There's not a huge amount of information about Halo 4 or 5 I've been able to find.  Right now the only Halo game I know I can tackle is Halo Wars 2 (which is really quite interesting when you know how that game works).",

You can't really do objective discussions about things when people aren't willing to treat it academically/impartially.

    "body": "Wow once again\n\nHe said \n\nBTB was unplayable for those without DLC when the first map released, and he is wrong. \n\nBTB had no such thing until shortly after Halo 3 ODST which came out at the end of 2009. \n\nIt is a wrong point of reference, and the argument really does not hold if you use the right point of reference which would have been along the lines of \n\nI played Halo 3 before it got DLC and when I fired it up 3 years later after multiple revisions I could not play BTB. It is quite the different story. \n\nUltimately someone is trying to throw people under the bus based on false information, I get it Bungie sucks now, but if you want to attack them for breathing life into a dying game 2-3 years after it came in out and asking for your money in the process you can just GTFO. \n\nYou had people that charge $15 a month and $60 a year for GaaS games, and we want to be up in arms over requiring you to spend maybe like $60 after years of free support  to refresh a game. Things were different than Halo 3 is a prime example of paid DLC problems in the way you would not think. It did not split a community, it just added $10 playlists with new maps people played for a week or two. It is safer to say map packs were a waster of money and added nothing to the base experience of the game\n\nThe game had three core alterations\n\n1) Base release game \n\n2) Heroic map being free\n\n3) Halo 3 ODST - when all content became universal and required money. \n\nHalo 3 after ODST was a new behemoth with maps for your maps in all playlists. I played Halo 3 for years, and if some run of a mill Joe who fires Halo 3 up after not playing it for 2-3 years wants to get his panties in a bunch that is his problem. I needed the 'expansion' that was integrating all DLC into the core experience. \n\nPaid MP DLCs are a joke, because despite what people say they are not paywalls they are broken promises for those actually willing to pay for more. Only game series that did not have this problem was BF, but it had a plethora of other paid DLC problems. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI played Halo 3 for 3+years regularly and bought 4 map packs and then ODST, and I can tell you first hand Halo 3 never locked the core modes behind DLC paywalls until they made a standardized rerelease in the form of ODST, which was 2+ years after the game launched well after the first DLC as OP claims.",
