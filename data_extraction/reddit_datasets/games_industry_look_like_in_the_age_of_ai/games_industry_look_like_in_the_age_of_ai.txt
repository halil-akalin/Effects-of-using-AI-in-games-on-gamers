It doesn't matter. If you gonna make game, you gonna make it.

This is why indie games with retro graphics or even text adventure game still existed. They don't care to move to 3D photorealistic at all. 

Same as AI. They don't have to use it to make a game. They just make game their way. It also apply to engine choice as well. Even today, someone still make their own engine in order to make game.
I'll add a counter argument. There has never been a better time to be in games. There's things generative AI brings to the table that solve long standing gaps in gaming. The next 10 years are going to see an explosion of creativity and exploration of games, gaming technologies that's unprecedented.

Think of how hollow and brittle current games are with NPCs, with simulation of world events. Games also have a content problem, where we cant scale good content to match the desires of gamers. There's an endless list of ways in which AI can aid us. Current focus on GPT as a chatbot is not looking deep enough.

Now, selling games is an entirely different matter. But as someone who is excited about seeing the art of games advance, this is going to be fire.

Also, consider checking out my subreddit /r/aigamedev
The recent advances in AI that you're talking about don't really exist, outside of niche applications. There are some notable exceptions, but otherwise the field has been stagnant for decades.

What people think is advancement is merely using bigger and bigger datasets. ChatGPT is a prime example of this. They used enormous amounts of training data to get it to be even somewhat useful.

Here's the thing about training data. Very few have access to it, and it's ultra expensive to acquire and work with it, unless you steal it of course. It's mostly useless to small budget companies for basing complex products on.

The age of AI is not here yet. Until we have AI models that can be trained using the data generated by a very small number of people (say below 100), I wouldn't discount the importance of traditional development just yet.
AI was a popular topic at GDC this year. Several platforms are integrating ChatGPT or similar services, which can already generate code. There are others looking at 2D to 3D generation, procedural generation, and other automation. Large studios like Epic are making investments in this area, so I expect fairly rapid adoption over the next few years. Check out the State of Unreal.
The 1980s.

Probably the late 1980s and early 1990s.  

Yes, AI is improving substantially.  But it's been around for 50 years.  Perhaps you want to rephrase your question to "games using the next generation of AI?"
Probably never, the current nueral net/machine learning has massive problems both in being part of the production flow and lots of legal problems including copyright.
Never? AI as it stands now (machine learning models/neural nets) generating content and stuff is already a legislative hell and the prospect of using it in commercial products is unlikely at a large scale.

Right now it’s in “boom” aka some major advancements that interest the general public which is why it’s making the waves right now. But it will settle out and the general public will lose interest and it will just because an aspect of everything. It will continue to improve and get better but it will never replace creators. Sure you will see assholes like Ubisoft try and eek out junior positions with their script writer AI tools and stuff but look at all the backlash that got already. Companies will always try to save money but at the end of the day creators don’t have to let it control the industry.

You don’t personally have to use any AI tools or whatever and you don’t have to let it discourage you either. Do what you need to and take the time you need to consider your options but you should never stop creating what you want to create just because of things like this. It was just the other day that everyone wanted to make NFT & Blockchain game and we see how well that went.
If you’re worried about AI in general, there’s no industry you can hide in. Even physical trades will be affected by rapidly advancing robotics.

The best way to protect yourself from AI is to master wielding it.

That doesn’t mean losing your creativity or your own bespoke craftsmanship. AI is just a tool.

Don’t be like a hand-painter lamenting the invention of Photoshop and the death or their artistry.

The world will always change and you have to adapt to remain a part of its culture and industry.
Meh. I remember when “high level” languages that compiled to machine code were considered to be the death knell of “real” programmers. Or when people complained that nobody was learning “vanilla” JS anymore.

AI is just another abstraction that further removes the dev from the machine. You can choose to use it or not.
AI won't replace solo game developers' jobs for several reasons, even though AI has made significant advancements in recent years. Here are some key reasons why solo game developers will continue to be relevant:  
  
Creativity and Originality: AI can generate content based on patterns and data it has been trained on, but it still lacks the ability to create truly original and innovative concepts. Solo game developers can come up with unique ideas, characters, and storylines that AI might struggle to create.  
  
Emotional Intelligence: Human game developers have a deep understanding of human emotions and can create experiences that evoke emotional responses from players. AI, on the other hand, lacks the emotional intelligence to create nuanced experiences that resonate with players on a deeper level.  
  
Complex Decision-Making: Game development often involves making complex decisions based on multiple factors, such as design, budget, and player feedback. AI might be able to assist with some aspects of decision-making, but it is not yet capable of understanding and balancing all the factors that go into game development.  
  
Artistic Vision: Solo game developers often have a strong artistic vision for their games, which helps them create unique experiences. AI-generated content, while impressive, can sometimes lack the personal touch and distinctiveness that comes from an individual's artistic vision.  
  
Collaboration and Communication: Game development often requires collaboration and communication with others, such as artists, musicians, and writers. Solo game developers are skilled at working with others to bring their ideas to life, while AI still struggles with understanding and responding to human communication in a meaningful way.  
  
Adaptability: Game developers need to adapt to new technologies, trends, and player expectations. While AI can be trained to adapt to some extent, human developers can more easily adjust their approach based on the ever-changing landscape of the gaming industry.  
  
In summary, AI has the potential to assist solo game developers in various aspects of game development, but it is unlikely to replace their jobs entirely. Human game developers possess unique skills, creativity, and emotional intelligence that are difficult to replicate with AI, allowing them to create experiences that resonate with players on a deeper level.

Chatgpt's answer
Ai will at best be able to make super simple games in our lifetime. There's a huge difference between generating a script and a whole game.
People still spend their time and money on candy crush.

AI isn't going to steal anybody's candies.

Just because you can build StarCraft 3 in 5 minutes of prompting doesn't mean you're going to have a good game. And no, AI won't be building StarCraft 3.
To your question of *How long?*, unfortunately the answer for indie devs/small studios is ***last month***.

Before the end of this year, we will have fully AI generated scripts, short-form movies, and soundtracks, with AI actors and voices. In fact, we should have this by summer.

*Every* knowledge-based industry will change over the next few months. Especially gaming, with a projected **$396 billion** in gaming revenue for 2023.

If you aren't starting to incorporate AI into your tool set, you will be left far, far behind.

- 2d / 3d texture map graphical assets can be currently generated. 
- AI generate pixel art is already in play.
- AI generated audio [music, speech] exists.
- AI generated content that caters to individual players.
- So much more...

The next/current level of chat bots that will take absolutely takeover **all** social media with *un-fucking-precedented* coherency and mind blowing conversational skills. This means you can stuff all your social media with bots that are all but indistinguishable from humans -right now. [if it's not clear, that translates to a marketing team that costs pennies to operate 24/7].

All the pieces exist and are falling very neatly in place as we type.

*Should you go into carpentry?* If you don't already make a good living making games *AND* you are choosing to ignore AI in your tool set, then **yes**, go into carpentry. 

Or focus on B2B application development.
 
You will not catch up without AI.
Is this post generated as a generic reply to some other post?

Doesn't address anything I said at all.
Is there really need for such pedantics? With current events, I think it is fairly clear what I am referring to.
>lots of legal problems including copyright.

the only people that think this are people that don't actually understand copyright law

the only major open question is can the works produced by AI be copyrighted, and the answer seems to be "only if a human also had significant involvement", so that's a pretty big gray area.  This is a question that will be answered in the next few years.
>legal problems including copyright

The only problems are about dataset distribution, LAION-5B might be invalid if deemed not sufficiently transformative, unlike google books.

Also, this is a to the absolute-T a technological war issue. No sane court is going to rule against training material consumption and would only ever rule about distribution. Ruling against the use of copy-written training material means giving unilateral victory to other parties (China will just do its' thing and own everyone by giving zero shits).

AI is a war and infrastructure power issue at the lowest.
"probably never"

funniest shit I've ever read

don't hide your head in the sand
The legal “problems” are massively over blown. The legal issues will settle out the way they always settle out…in favour of those who lobby best. Which means that if big content producers want generative assets copyrightable…they will end up copyrightable.
I don't understand why people say "never"

give me a reason why this is not a counterpoint to your argument then

[https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/](https://www.reddit.com/r/blender/comments/121lhfq/)
AI has the potential to replace many jobs, including those of solo game developers, for several reasons:  
  
Improved efficiency: AI can perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans, which means that the development of games can be streamlined. As AI technology advances, it can automate many aspects of game development, such as coding, designing, and testing, freeing up time for developers to focus on other aspects of the project or even making their jobs obsolete.  
  
Cost-effectiveness: Employing AI can be more cost-effective than hiring human developers, as AI doesn't require benefits, vacations, or a salary. This economic advantage may lead game development companies to invest in AI technology to reduce costs, which could lead to a reduced demand for solo game developers.  
  
Advanced tools: AI-driven tools are becoming more sophisticated and capable of generating complex assets, such as 3D models, textures, animations, and even procedural level design. These tools can greatly reduce the workload of a solo game developer and, in some cases, replace the need for their expertise altogether.  
  
Procedural content generation: AI can generate game content procedurally, creating endless variations of levels, characters, and narratives. This technology can potentially replace solo game developers as it can create game worlds and stories that would take a human developer significantly more time to create.  
  
Personalized gaming experiences: AI can analyze player behavior and preferences, tailoring game experiences to individual players. This level of personalization can be hard for solo game developers to achieve, as it requires a deep understanding of user data and the ability to adapt the game in real-time based on this information.  
  
However, it is essential to note that while AI can replace certain tasks and aspects of a solo game developer's job, it may not be able to fully replace human creativity, intuition, and the unique perspective that a solo game developer brings to their work. As AI technology advances, it is more likely that it will complement and augment the work of game developers rather than fully replace them.

further chatgpt's answer
last month games that are using AI got released substantially?

can you name some so I can take a look?
Their point is, if you want to keep doing things the way you're choosing to do them, then as a solo dev you have that prerogative.  If you don't want to be an AI prompter -> editor or whatever, then just *don't use those tools*.  But also, don't be afraid of new tools.

That said, you're thinking way too far ahead.  AI creating any meaningful game requires having enough understanding of interconnecting complex mechanics and knowing what makes something fun.  This level of AI is decades away if it's even possible at all.
ID3 and K-NNs have been used for ages.

They're still learning models that benefit from adversarial training.

Killer Instinct literally has you train a K-NN dataset with the whole shadow system.

There's more than just deep useless learning out there.
Idk why others downvoted you here. I hate people who talk like that. Pedantic nonsense.
No AAA is going to risk having their assets unprotected by copyright. It is a huge grey area and publishers do not roll dice with their IP.
Nice anecdotal evidence you got there
I saw you already posted this and would probably say something.

To me this is just part of the “boom” period of all this just like NFT/Blockchain stuff the last few years. They basically say their boss doesn’t care about the product and just wants to make money and save time. Yeah that’s gonna happen and it’s to be expected, but I wouldn’t expect it on a large scale. You will see it happen sure, but it’s not gonna consume everything and take over in my opinion.

I’m sorry if it gets you down and I hope you can still find passion and joy in creating and making things.
My personal human opinion, it is a great tool, for solo developers like us, it helps me a lot and will save me money.

Unless you are a concept artist or a translator, your job are alright in the next couple of years
Right now no one [or no studio] is going to admit to using AI assets/assistance since the both the massive negative public opinion and the murky legality are huge issues. During the 'last month', a bunch of AI projects really took off. Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT being some of the most talked about.

Here's a glimpse of what is *publicly* available on right now:

- mubert
- stable diffusion
- nvidia nerf
- llama llm
- copilot

You'll see very quickly how much AI is affecting all facets of game dev.
3-4 years away.
I disagree

luddites should just get out
I do think it's very likely that it's going to come down on the side of the things AI makes will be copyrighted.
exactly

indie games will be flooded with AI generated stuff

either way steam was already flooded with asset flips

indies never stood a chance
gamedevs mindbroken are really an amazing sight
So ridiculous

So many people who cannot answer a question
My previous statement is more about 3D games than *any* game.  Given that the idea of "video game" is an extremely broad concept with an even wider breadth of quality and content, can you say which game or genre that exists today you think AI might be able to replicate in 3-4 years time?

Personally, I actually wouldn't be surprised if AI is capable of reaching a rudimentary 2D Metroidvania style game by then.  Of course, how fun that game is (game design) and how well it flows (level design) I think would still be significantly lacking in that time.

But meaningful 3D games with complex, overlapping mechanics?  Not gonna happen any time soon
Based
though, who knows for sure I guess https://www.reuters.com/legal/ai-created-images-lose-us-copyrights-test-new-technology-2023-02-22/
Good luck out there, brother!
AI is 3-4 years away from being capable of making any game, of any genre, with enough rigorous detailed input. You will not be able to tell it to "make a game just like Skyrim" in 3-4 years but I'm confident that you will be able to sit down with it and extract 99% of what is necessary to make a game like Skyrim in that time.
Welp, only time will tell
