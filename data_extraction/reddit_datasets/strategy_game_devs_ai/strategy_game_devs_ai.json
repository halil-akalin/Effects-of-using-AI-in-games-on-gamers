    "body": "Generally speaking, in games that are not \"solvable\" (solvable as in like Tic-tac-toe, or chess) you're best bet is to build a hierarchical tree of systems (tied to states) trying to work toward achieving predefined goals, starting on the global scale and then going down the hierarchy diverting work to sub-system depending on current state of the game.  \nIn other words your AI would start each round by checking:  \nAm I in danger? -> Go to a system that deals with preventing defeat.\nAm I safe? -> Go to a system that deals with furthering my chances at achieving victory.  \nThen those systems will look at the state of the game, and divert work to further sub-systems depending on what needs to be done. If AI doesn't have units to defend itself, it will let \"unit-building-system\" take over with directive to build more units. Then finally at the very bottom there's a \"factory-managing-system\" that looks at the current priorities and decides which buildings should start building units.  \nBuilding the AI as a hierarchy like this is very easy to reason about, and breaking the logic into tiny sub-systems (micro-services if you will) makes them very easy to move around depending on what needs to be done. As in, once one micro-system is done, another can be queued up to do their work, if higher-level systems decide it's good idea to do so.",

    "body": "I've build quite a few strategy game ai's. What you want to do is this. Have layered systems with each layer providing context for the layers below it.\n\nFor instance a top layer should evaluate the overall state of a faction and set a strategic stance. Some stances might be: a) Early game expansion, explore the map and prioritize long term decision making. b) Mid game expecting a big war soon. Collect resources and don't expose yourself. c) Bankrupt and attacked from all sides.  Hunker down and concentrate on short term survival.\n\nA subsystem that controls scouting could then base decisions of off the above. a) Scout far and wide, give a high priority to building/acquiring units for scouting. b) Maybe retain some modest scouting capability if there's unexplored map. If it's relevant to your game then maybe concentrate on gathering information about potential opponents. c) No scouting necessary.\n\nSimilarly a system concerned with building improvements can reason. a) Calculate the return on investment over a long period. b) Calculate the ROI on a medium period. If the site is near an expected front line reduce expected benefit further to account for risk of loss in a war. c) Doesn't contribute to short term survival so don't even think about it.\n\nGiven the above reasoning, subsystems can request production/unit allocation and set priorities for their requests. Production and resource allocation systems can then fill these requests according to priorities.\n\nWriting an AI is a lot of work as there are many factors to take into account for each decision. Expect your code to become large and complex. When thinking about the ai, think about how you'd make decisions and what factors you'd take into account.\n\nDon't be afraid to cheat where the player won't notice. Eg don't write ten thousand lines of code to estimate an enemy's overall strength based on unit sightings, just examine the game state. It's such an abstract piece of information the player will never notice. Similarly the player will notice if the AI doesn't scout, but that doesn't mean you can't examine the game map to find nice locations to send your scouts to.\n\nIf your game has complex diplomacy, expect this to be 40-50% of your AI effort, and however much time you spend on it, expect players to still bitch about it more than anything else.",

Also, pick a number of move look a-heads. The computer considers all moves and scores them, then considers all the moves after the first moves and scores them. It assumes the opponent (human player) will pick the best move by score for the human player. And will pick it's move so that it results in the best board state for the computer after the opponent has moved. Hopefully I explained that well. There are a lot of ways to cull obviously bad move in the decision from being considered, and ways to optimize to make it faster. If you have rng damage then assume the average or expected damage is given. The board state score is likely based on unit count and health, though you can do other score values based on board position attributes like ranged units being close to melee units results in a lower score etc.\n\nEdit: I must confess I misread the post as being turn base strategy meaning a tactics style game, not a 4x game. Other devs have correctly pointed out, unless your 4x game is incredibly simple, this approach will have too wide of a decision space, and the decisions will have consequences too far in the future, for this to be a viable approach.",

Use a genetic algorithm (this is how your own brain evolved!), ie. after each generation, take the 50% best players and randomly combine (\"crossbreed\") their parameters.\n\nTest them against real players. They will probably be too good, so at this point you want to apply some more subtle mutations for a few generations to worsen the AI and produce the various difficulty levels. (This mutation will also result in some idiosyncrasies that you can leverage to make the gameplay more interesting, eg. generate a few different AIs and randomly select them for each match.)\n\nI think some games have done it like this, but they seem to be in the minority. I think the main reason is that it's harder to get predictable results, or to fine-tune it when it doesn't do what you want. (ie. how do you \"reprogram\" a neural network?

The more complex the AI the better ML is as a solution. I have also used ML to play a game instead of having 1000 testers. The ML was able to identify bugs in the games I would have needed many play testers to do.",

Orders are simple and carried out by the units without involvement of the AI.\n\nE.g. a possible order might be \"attack unit x in tile y\" and it's score will be the base weight for the order type (in this case the type is \"attack unit\") modified by things like expected outcome (ratio of dealt/received damage) and distance.\n\nThere's no coordination between units or optimization going on. The AI is just a greedy algorithm that scores all orders, picks the one with the highest score and repeats.\n\nI understand I might not get great results with this approach but I'm still curious how much better it could be with just better weights and modifiers.",
