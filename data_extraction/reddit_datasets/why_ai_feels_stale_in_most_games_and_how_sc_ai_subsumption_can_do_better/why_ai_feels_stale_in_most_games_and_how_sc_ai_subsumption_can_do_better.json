    "body": "So I was listening to number of videos and presentations on SC's AI Subsumption, including some more recent ones concerning the developer's progress in programming the AI to interact with objects in the world, and it occurred to me that they never once mentioned AI social units, and how it would affect object interaction.  In almost any photographed instance of a public park or gathering area, there are always either an even number or greater number of social units vs. individuals going about daily tasks - even during a work day and in areas where there are little to no tourists.  It seems like such a small thing, but in reality it has a huge impact on the life-likeness of the AI in SC.  I wanted to create this thread to put this out there for discussion, and to invite anyone who may have heard something like this come out of the dev team to share what they know.  I really believe in SC, and what I have heard about AI subsumption is truly incredible, I just hope that even in the early stages that there is some discussion on this topic.  I think this sort of thing could really bring the world of SC so much closer to feeling like the AI are part of a living, breathing universe.  ",

    "body": "It doesn't have to mean anything. Years ago I programmed a function to simulate fluff NPC population for an AD&D server (NWN1/2 for those who know the acronyms). The idea was to have them act similar to the NPCs in... Oblivion I think?.\n\nIt basically worked by placing down waypoints denoting places of interest that the NPCs would walk to. Once close enough to the waypoint the NPC would look at all objects within a set distance, pick one randomly and start \"interacting\" with it - that is, play some animation. So they sat on chairs, hammered on an anvil and so on.\n\nIf the object picked randomly was another NPC they started interacting with them. This worked pretty well, although I quickly turned off the \"start a real conversation with the other NPC\" because any place with a decent amount of NPCs was so filled with chatter that you could not see the players talk any more. \n\nBut the point is, you don't need to define social groups. In fact it becomes more dynamic if you don't as random NPCs can interact with each other - provided you programmed an appropriate routine and there is an animation for it.",

Or take the Mass Effect approach (I'm sure many others do this) and create small story arcs that the two npcs can follow and talk about. \n\nNow with subsumption all of these npcs have daily lives. They leave their residence, move to their job, post, whatever entails in their daily life. Now you start factoring in things like living and so on till it basically becomes a SIMs game. Now I'm not saying this can't be done, but slipping in random meetings with scripted conversations with procedurally generated worlds and cities is going to be a massive undertaking. \n\nWe're talking about being able to have an AI literally generate a conversation that's more or less random that falls in along parameters of being relevant to where they are and what time.

In games like GTA, the AI will initiate a conversation when it comes into contact within another AI's conversation zone. At which point they will face each other in conversation animation. Then they will pull from their flow chart of possible statements a beginner, or conversation opener. Depending on the random opener the conversation will proceed through a series of flow charts with dialogue that roughly makes sense. In GTA this is obviously fairly simple, someone says something wierd > therefore the response is what? Your crazy! Pretty simple. \n\nIn Star citizen from what I have read and seen, they want to have AI with a purpose, this differs from GTA in that the characters are randomly generated and pop in and out of existence. In SC they will have schedules that they follow even when they don't physically exist. Games like Skyrim have ai like this. They are at home asleep at night and doing their job during the day based on a schedule. New waypoints generate at certain times. Of course Skyrim's dialogue doesn't change based on the time of day leading to some awkward bedside conversations. \n\nI would assume that SC will have a similar timed waypoint system with random flow chart based conversations. Hopefully better than GTA, possibly they could incorporate time of day conversation charts so I'm not waking someone up to have a conversation about ship sales at Astro Armada.",

In SC they will have schedules that they follow even when they don't physically exist.\n\nActually, from everything I have read, it sounds like SC is using a combination of both. The majority of NPCS will be radonmly generated on the fly, what CR was calling their background crowd simulation for landing zones, based on the high level economic simulation, your location, your ship types and numbers (in the case of generated enemies in space), and missions you might have. Some NPCs like mission givers will persist and follow and schedule.\n\nEdit: so hard to find any sources these days, but I found one that is relevant.\n\n[10FTC Episode 78 Question 2](http://scqa.info/?show=10FTC&episode=78&qid=2)\n\n>So what's going to happen is that we have a universe simulation that runs on a separate server. That's much more of a big picture simulation. Think of it kind of like a Civilization game or something like that. Sort of a slower turn based game. That actually is simulating the universe, what all the NPCs are doing, on a macro basis. Who's trading with what? What's producing what? What goods are needed where? Where pirates are attacking? The sort of general outcomes of those results are all happening on the universe simulation and it's own process. Then that is getting trickled down to the local game servers that all the players (i.e. you guys), are attaching to and playing in. The snapshot of what's happening on the universe server is sort of carried across the game server.\n\n>What would happen is, for instance, if you were down on a planet it would say, \"Okay, well this planet is a mining planet and, you know, so I'll generate and the population is this size; therefore, we'll probably populate the landing area with 'X' number of NPCs, 60% of them will be miners, and then we'll have some, law enforcement, and you know we'll have some service workers in the bars and stuff like that.\" It will all be generated by the data that's pulled down, or pushed down, from the universe server, so it will dynamically change.\n",

You might stack up sound files in a repository if the count rarely bypasses the threshold. When your inventory of sound files is high, you save expenses on the voice-actors. This might not be the best or worst solution, it has some drawbacks (what if that voice-actor dies? should he die in-game too? is this even ethically responsible?).
