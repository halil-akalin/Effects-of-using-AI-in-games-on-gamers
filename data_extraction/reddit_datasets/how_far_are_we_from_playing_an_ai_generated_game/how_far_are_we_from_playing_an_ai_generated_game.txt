Unless the game is very formulaic, in which case the AI is just reproducing a template and filling it in with AI generated variables(which is feasible currently, requires no AI and is somewhat trivial to do), we are probably closer to colonizing mars. We are also probably closer to simulating a full human brain. Why? Because that's essentially what it takes.

There are so many fields of expertise intertwined that AIs will need to be much more general than they currently are, and that generality will almost certainly need to match the human brain. Games have a purpose, but AIs are all ad hoc. That means they do not plan, they just make it up. That's why the only way I see them creating games is if they follow very strict rules. If they ever get to a point where it's possible to create a truly "AI-generated game", then they will almost certainly be comparable to the human intellect. That's very far off. And that's not even getting into the "originality" problem.

Also notice "AI-generated game" is vague. Using AI-generated content in games is certainly possible, while it is also possible to play games with ChatGPT and possibly ask it to generate basic rules for a text-based game. In that case, it's possible already. However, if you are comparing it to games a game developer can make, what I said in the first two paragraphs applies.
Extremely far. Unless you want to play shitty video games.
Very far away. Better to think of ChatGPT as a Chatbot, which it actually is, than as an AI. It has no conceptual understanding of what is says.
I think rendering will take big hops in the future, like snapchat ai filters but on steroids that can do all the basic post processing things cheaply. Already happening with the render low res => upscale with AI
What's the point of consuming generated AI content tho? I'm not saying that it cannot generate good content, but a future where any media I consume is generated by an AI feels extremely dystopian to me. It has no soul. It's like it's been designed to maximize profits like always.

I don't want a random game fully AI-generated. I want to listen to a real person comment his reasoning behind game design decisions. I want someone to tell why a balancing decision was made. I want artists to know how it felt to make their characters and designs alive. I want to read the sound designers experience while recording and making sounds for their games. I want to see everything put together with passion a dedication.

AI has nothing of that. I can see AI as an assistance tool and I can value it. I'd rather train an AI to analyze code ans detect bugs with precision, for example. But I can't see why anyone would like AI games to be a thing.
Yeah I think that is not for tomorrow, but IMO that could give good surprises, maybe inovative gameplay or mechanics. I think that could be interesting to have something that doesn't think like a human.

Not that far I don't think. I have been playing around and have an AI that can make all the objects for a game. Eg the units, terrain, map and their code. from a single prompt asking the user for the theme. 

[https://app.cambrian.gg/](https://app.cambrian.gg/) is the site I am putting these generators, at the moment the site will let you build cards and decks of cards to play Top Trumps with.
There's not going to be an easy way to have a FULLY AI-generated game any time soon as AI isn't yet designed to do much without human input.

AI will continue to be used in game creation and realistically has been used since we had games with procedural generation.  Most AI is still far closer to basic procedural generation than it is to human intelligence.
Since you can train AI to play games, it should, in theory, be able to improve games too from its experience. But since most AI only has one or a few models of knowledge, it would be difficult to create a game that can compete with what a human can make. We're slower, but we understand far more concepts
If you're trying to use AI as a short hand for effortless game then you don't need AI, you just need a pipeline and being completely careless about the games you put out.

I want to die
We have some stuff in the works at r/themirrorspace. We're pretty early but I'd love to get your thoughts when we're closer to it!
About as far of a drop from your Ego down to your IQ
Chat GPT did not create code. It just took available code you can google yourself. Thats why it will be often buggy and can use outdated deprecated syntax or methods/functions. 

We are still far away. Not this or next year and probably not next 5 years.
Probably not long before as a gimmick most things in a game are advertised as AI generated and promoted through dumb fluff pieces as a selling point. Then there will probably follow a period of shovelware with terrible gameplay mechanics to turn people off from that for awhile.
Define AI-generated game. We can talk about some elements (like assets, or code), maybe even idea, but AI does not possess capability for creative process. It will not know if content it generated is appealing, if code it generated works without issues, if idea it generates is interesting to play through. Not to mention it will never go outside defined model it learned on.
Not very far at all. We just launched our alpha last week. You can turn social media trends into dreamworlds using AI (all art made in-house). If you like Fortnite or Only Up you may like Auxworld.
So it will kick off on mobile next year, got it.
Try not think about commercial games, but H5 mini games for side events? Would that be possible?
Shitty video games make billions of dollars so I'm ok with it
This makes me think of the Google rumors earlier about sentient AI... I wasn't mean to discuss this merely with chatgpt, but i wonder if sentient has any relationship with game making tho?
I'm just wondering since AIs are fed by human data, would they achieve something beyond humans? For instance, the weird finger thingy from AI arts.
I don't know what an H5 mini game is or a side event. So... Maybe?
They really don't.
Simple enough:

* If the game is shitty, no one would like it;
* if no one would like it, no one would buy it, or spend money in it;
* if no one would buy it, it would not make money;

So, no, if game makes a lot of money, it means it appeals to a huge audience, and this means it can't be objectively shitty, no matter how do you hate it.
It's just some hype the Google PR team put out.
That what I was thinking of, those weird stuff AI can produce. Sometimes, those weird stuff turns aesthetically pleasant. Even if there is a good chance that 99.99% of what it can produce is garbage, I think you can have gold in those 0.01%.  


Does feeding a machine human knowledge will automaticaly produce something human already knows ? I don't know. At first I would say no.

That reminds me the [Infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem) . Humans produces billions of prompts which produce garbage, but one of them will produce the best mechanics we could think of.  
This is just my opinion, maybe the is nonsense for AI professionals.
**[Infinite monkey theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem)** 
 
 >The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the probability that monkeys filling the entire observable universe would type a single complete work, such as Shakespeare's Hamlet, is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).
