    "body": "Unless the game is very formulaic, in which case the AI is just reproducing a template and filling it in with AI generated variables(which is feasible currently, requires no AI and is somewhat trivial to do), we are probably closer to colonizing mars. We are also probably closer to simulating a full human brain. Why? Because that's essentially what it takes.\n\nThere are so many fields of expertise intertwined that AIs will need to be much more general than they currently are, and that generality will almost certainly need to match the human brain. Games have a purpose, but AIs are all ad hoc. That means they do not plan, they just make it up. That's why the only way I see them creating games is if they follow very strict rules. If they ever get to a point where it's possible to create a truly \"AI-generated game\", then they will almost certainly be comparable to the human intellect. That's very far off. And that's not even getting into the \"originality\" problem.\n\nAlso notice \"AI-generated game\" is vague. Using AI-generated content in games is certainly possible, while it is also possible to play games with ChatGPT and possibly ask it to generate basic rules for a text-based game. In that case, it's possible already. However, if you are comparing it to games a game developer can make, what I said in the first two paragraphs applies.",

I'm not saying that it cannot generate good content, but a future where any media I consume is generated by an AI feels extremely dystopian to me. It has no soul. It's like it's been designed to maximize profits like always.\n\nI don't want a random game fully AI-generated. I want to listen to a real person comment his reasoning behind game design decisions. I want someone to tell why a balancing decision was made. I want artists to know how it felt to make their characters and designs alive. I want to read the sound designers experience while recording and making sounds for their games. I want to see everything put together with passion a dedication.\n\nAI has nothing of that. I can see AI as an assistance tool and I can value it. I'd rather train an AI to analyze code ans detect bugs with precision, for example.
