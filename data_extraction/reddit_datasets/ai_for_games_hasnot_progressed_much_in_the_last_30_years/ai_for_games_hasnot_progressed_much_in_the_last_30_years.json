    "body": "> I mean, look at a game from 30 years ago, and it will be a ugly, almost unusable 2D game, but the AI will play about the same. \n\nThere are a few reasons. To get the elephant in the room out of the way first, lets start with this: it's not worth investing time and effort into making good game AI as there's no return on investment: good AI doesn't help sell the game. By the time weaknesses in the AI comes to light, the player has not just already _bought_ the game, he's already become _invested_ in it -- any complaints they make about the AI will usually occur in a wider discussion of the game that boosts, rather than detracts, from people's interest in the game.\n\nNow, a few other reasons in no particular order:\n\nGames are much larger now than they were 30 years ago. They have much wider state-spaces -- RTS instead of turn-based, pixel-resolution maps rather than hexes, hundreds of units rather than dozens -- even the rule spaces tend to be larger as, particularly AA games, have to include a larger number of game systems to be saleable today. By today's standards, something like the original Civilization or Dune II would seem anemic as a major title. All this makes it a great deal harder to write good AI for video games today.\n\nGames are balanced differently now than they used to be. Today, games are balanced with an eye towards multiplayer games. That didn't use to be the case to the same extent. This makes it harder to \"tilt the table\" in favour of the AI. That means its harder to write an AI that provides the player with a proper challenge, since the AI code has to carry more of the burden.\n\nRelated to the previous point, the expectations players have for the AI has changed. It's no longer enough that the AI provides a suitable challenge for the player to overcome, it now also has to provide the same overall _feel_ of challenge as a human opponent would. It used to be you played against the game, but now you expect to play against the AI, with the game as an apparently neutral battleground for you to match wits on -- that is a _much_ harder thing to write AI to do.\n\nThere's probably also a little bit of \"survivor bias\" at play -- we tend to compare the strategy games of today not against the strategy games of yesterday, but against the strategy games of yesterday that _stood the test of the time_. There were plenty of games with atrocious and laughably bad AI released in the 80ties and 90ties too.",

    "body": "TLDR: because currently game programmers have to make their own AI and things like graphics and such are done for them in most cases. They just have to use it. but an AI? they would have to build the concept themselves if they want a good one.(and it still wont be that good)\n   \n\nPrimarily I believe the issue is... Its really expensive.\nGame coders in general get paid less than other industry alternatives. according to glass door and such. AI programming is not a joke. its a serious concept and a good AI programmer could get a much higher paying job doing something, just about anything, else with that skill.   \n\nBut eventually the concepts of AI will be formulated well. What do i mean by that? take pathing for example. how to get a unit to go from point a to point b. Seems pretty simple and it is for the human brain. But computers have no innate spacial awareness. They cant assume something is in the way. They have to have code that tells them that something is in the way.\nDid you know that pathing is a big deal? Its serious math. People with doctorates win prizes coming up with pathing formulas. \nBecause it can be used in many concepts. GPS driving assistant? pathing. likely using the same pathing concept that many games use. Why? because its been solidly proven and worked on by people with PHD's in mathematics. Its a big deal.   \n\nThose pathing concepts are already made. it can basically be plugged into a game via an existing code chunk and made to work.   \n\nWhy is that relevant to the AI discussion...\nbecause the AI plugins are not as available in a high quality well thought out concept that will work on a variety of game types especially 4x as 4x is really complicated in concept.  \n\nIt will be. But hell developers are just getting to the point robots can stand and walk around near human style or even be able to talk to a human with human not being able to tell its a AI. It took a massive computer to play serious chess several decades ago. not that long ago a computer was made dedicated to play jeopardy and it did ok.\n \nWhats the point...\nthe point is that until a really good AI can be packaged into a code chunk and a game architect can take that package and fairly easily apply to their game the AI is going to be pretty simple. Else the AI being good would be a big feature.  \nCurrently a lot of stuff in game is not to have a super complete really great system... The point is to have a decent player experience. The AI can appear to be decent with tricks and as long as the player doesn't know those tricks and those tricks give the player some challenge then whats the difference.  \nEven games like AI wars use tricks to help the AI do what it needs. \n\nGraphics systems fall into the same concept of pathing. Its not used just for games and people have thought the hell out of how to make it work to the point that a code simpleton like myself can say put a light right here and make it cast a shadow and reflect and stuff. Because all the stuff that makes that happen is already done i just have to use it.  \n\nDisclaimer...   \nI dont really know what i am talking about. :p no seriously this is deep and complex topic. But the idea is that good AI design is not easily available to joe schmoe designer. Not like graphics are. So the designer has to build out some really complex ideas from scratch. Even those programmers from 30 years ago did not have to build into the computer how to draw something. it was already there. there is no AI in a computer. ",

Gaming AIs aren't an intelligence at all, they are in essence very complex scripts that execute based on specific variables, which means that a programmer basically has to anticipate circumstances that aren't immediately apparent; this is compounded by the fact that games are becoming more complex, the more variables and circumstances there are, the more chances there are to break something. And because there is no \"intelligence\" there is nothing to make 'smarter' -- and in this context smarter doesn't mean anything.\n\nMore importantly, most people don't want smarter AI, what they want is an AI that reacts more intelligently, convincingly not necessarily smarter.\n\nAs an aside, I think AI is going to be one of those genies in a bottle that, if it ever happens, it'll be too late to put the genie back in. I personally don't want an AI that can anticipate everything I do before i do it. I don't want an AI that can outplay me like Spock at 3D chess, and I think for every one of you guys who wants to play against a Deep Blue, there's a hundred other people who are fine with most average difficulties. Which leads me to my final point:\n\nMost people don't play on extremely hard difficulties. Your average player, including 4x players, plays on average/normal difficulty -- at best ---and I suspect most below even that.\n\nI know speaking for myself, playing Civ VI, and Civ V, Prince/King difficulty is plenty challenging without feeling overwhelming. Part of me wishes I could play at Diety but the level of optimal play needed to be that good removes any sense of spontaneity that I genuinely like in a 4x game. In fact I've even lost a couple of games on Prince/King difficulty in Civ VI.\n\nSo AI is relative. What's easy for you is certainly not the case for all and the current state of AI is good for, I'd wager, 80 percent of gamers.\n\nTherefore from a development perspective when you consider the performance/overhead costs that an AI might contribute to a game, the fact that most average AI is good enough for average players who aren't hardcore armchair generals, and the already high costs of development, it doesn't make sense to make it a major investment of development but rather just \"good enough\" for the median gamer.",

It does this because it knows battleships are powerful but expensive so it wants some but can't afford too many. It uses the smaller ship types to round out holes in the BBs' weapons and to increase point defense.

They appear at different times so that max output may only come in 300 turns, so maybe you need to build different districts meanwhile. You also can't know if you'll be able to place another city nearby so its districts affect current ones. With mines and farms of previous games there was no question, even in Civ4 there was mostly a question of what is the city focus and so maybe you want food so much you build windmills instead of mines on the hills. Before Civ6 I can give you an AI that will build improvements with certain weight (on hills build mines unless you can build terrace or something) and you'd be hardress to recognize if the city is built by player or AI. In Civ6 you'll see idiotic placement at once.\n\nAnd there are lots of things like that.",

The end result is a game that is entierely focused on the early game, since the AI cant ever make a comeback.\n\nI agree with this thread 100%- good AI shouldnt be impossible. I get what people say, that fun AI is not the same as good AI. But right now in a lot of 4X games, it is neither. ",

AIs that act more human tend to provide that, usually given some level of cheating to provide increasing challenges. \n\nCompare it to an FPS, a smarter \"better\" AI is never going to miss with hit-scan weapons. It's going to see you, instantly move it's target to your face, and boom headshot. Then probably go camp your spawn point or something. \n\nPeople don't like that. Rather, they want to feel like a badass not a target. So instead of making super-competent AI, they tone it down and use tricks to make it more fun. A common example is that the AI is biased to miss in front of the player rather than behind or to the sides. That way when you're running and they open up with a machine gun, you see the bullets whizzing past in front of you or hitting the ground near you.\n\n> the voice of people who want better AI just more louder than the rest so it seems many want it\n\nOf course we are, the people who are happen with the standard gameplay don't say anything. It's only those of us who frequent forums/reddit/etc looking for things like AI mods and positing suggestions that actually speak up because we're the ones with complaints.\n",

And there's a relationships value for every pair of countries (so there's value for what England thinks of France and a separate one vice versa). And for most diplomatic actions there are limits for when you can't even attempt to do them. You can't ask for alliance unless both relationship values are more than 0. In most games you could and AI would answer no thanks. And in most games AI would probably evaluate such possibility himself. But there is a hard lock, no alliance is possible when relationships are low. For many actions there are cooldowns, like you can't ask the same nation 2 things in a row. This is done partly because AI only checks if he wants to ask anything once in couple of moths. He can't think of it more often so you can't too. Then there are soft and hard limits. There's a limit of how many diplomatic relations you can have, going over it costs you. This means you can't create elaborate alliance nets - AI couldn't do it anyway so you're even.",
