Using Python and R language, data was extracted from Reddit, tokenized and sentiment analyzed.


## Project purpose:

This project aims to investigate the usage of artificial intelligence in video games and analyze player reactions through text mining methods. The details of the project, including the utilized code and performed analyses, are outlined below.

## Project Contents:

- **Dataset:** The data was taken from some posts on the Reddit platform, especially posts where players expressed their opinions about artificial intelligence.
- **Code:** Data was pulled from Reddit via Python technologies. Data was cleaned and processed using the R language. The processing stages are tokenizing the data and performing sentiment analysis. After these processes, data visualization operations were performed.
- **Results:** As a result of the findings, it was seen that 65% of the players had a positive view on the use of artificial intelligence in video games. 35% expressed their negative thoughts with words.

## How to Use

1. **Dataset :** 
2. **Run the Code:** Execute the Python scripts and R bettiks to perform analyses. Don't forget to install the necessary dependencies.


3. **Review the Results:** Explore the results of the analyzes in pdfs in the data_processing folder.
