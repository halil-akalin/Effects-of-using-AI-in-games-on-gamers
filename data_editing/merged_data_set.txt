i dont play games where the point remotely lays in having full conversations where i as the player have to initiate fully formed questions and statements and if i did vn point and click etc i would prefer a bespoke and curated experience story and dialogue but hey thats me i cant speak for others i just see it as a bells and whistles sort of application to most current forms of gaming and cant see it as anything but a distraction in any kind of game where the point isnt to test the conversational capabilities of a nonhuman conversationalist 
i have to admit it would be kinda funny to ask zoltan in witcher three for example how to make a souffle just to see what he comes up with in his voice and affectation but again id show it to three friends who would only find it impressive if they hadnt seen it before i showed it to them wed all agree that it was cool and advanced and then id go back to wanting zoltan to help me figure out who dandelion was boning so we could track his whereabouts
a game just released during the twozerotwothree gamejam called detective gpt which integrates the ai pretty well its crude but a good first step
ai powered npc dialog is already being worked on but believable npc dialog is still probably a few years away this kind of tech is super promising and can really add so much to role playing in games
what i dont like to know is why all these discussion threads get donvoted to oblivion i wanna hear the discussions about it
its got some hurdles to overcome it took a week maybe two for that twitch show nothing forever  to get banned because it started to make transphobic jokes no developer or publisher is gonna want to put something into a game where they cant control what is going to be said
i would imagine as soon as a major game implements this the various ratings boards across the world will probably crack down on it so the only games that would get something like this are games that are already aiming for a mature audience
i dont think many people wanna manually input dialogue to talk to npcs it seems tedious to do so could work well for a visual novel or text adventure tho wouldnt be a lotta fun to have to contribute a lotta effort into talking to random npcs in a rpg i would like to see more life brot towards them tho it helps make the world feel alive when they react to occurrences that happen in the game i like talking to npcs in dragon quest because of that
i got a lot of joy out of npc to npc conversations in oblivion i imagine ai is probably already pretty good at simulating something similar the question is if the novelty would wear off if multiple games are doing it were more aware of the background process
todd howard has been talking a bit about it in his interview with lex friedman 
pretty interesting stuff 
this will most certainly be a reality in a few years imo
i really dont want this in games 
in almost every regard i would always prefer human written dialogue and story telling ai just cant match human emotion and storytelling if that results in less dialogue then thats a sacrifice im willing to make for quality
i think implementing such an ai would only work in online games as the best on device ai we have is still siri
what would an ai be able to accomplish in the field of npc chatter that wouldnt be better suited to a human in my experience an npc has to say very specific things or else what is even the point of it existing 
for example say its an inconsequential npc in a town of an rpg what information would you possible have to gain from them that isnt already solved by manual text is there a risk that an ai wouldnt understand what the player should or shouldnt know already and inadvertently give away plot points or would it perhaps just drone on and on about pointless information that doesnt even line up with another npcs text or maybe even conflict with the overarching plot or world building
ai isnt really intelligent its more akin to very complex algorithms than another human mind and if it does cross that threshold isnt it very inhumane to expect that we can make them slaves to our whims of creativity
in order for this to be not just a gimmick it needs to be just one aspect of the super npc ai each npc would need to be able to do three things 
one  have goals likes dislikes and the ability to change these things overtime
two  be able to acknowledge the changes in their world and voice an opinion on them
three have ability and initiative to affect the world outside of the players influence
throw in something that makes each npc even more unique like say letting each one develop an entirely original type of magic based on who they are and their past experiences and youve got a truly living breathing world whos population and landscape will shift and warp as power hungry mages ascend to lichdom only to be felled by heroes who rose to the call when their villages were destroyed and all of it without the player doing anything
im wondering if next gen consoles would have an integrated ai chip and use it to enhance reactivity and how npcs and the like could react to the player it doesnt have to be used for any real or central purpose but general world building and reactivity
well as a game developer i am certainly thinking of how to work towards more interesting npc ai with a transformer just in my hobby time i might then actually encounter npc interactions in my own game that surprise me and make the world that i create even more alive
and im not at all worried about the ai doing anything like taking over or being scary or something its still my storytelling but then smartly mixed very much like an interpolation machine between multiple text options that i tat it i like it
unreal engine integration with live ai chat wwwyoutubecomwatchvhfourvrnzeroxndgwwwyoutubecomwatchvhfourvrnzeroxndg
not onezero years away
well said
and it will be probably as shitty and generic as their ai generated quests
there is probably room for both in some games it could be interesting in others full designed and scripted events work better     
imagine a procedural games like no mans sky but with tons of full interactive npcs that can assigned story driven quests
i could see this being really fantastic for a game like no mans sky where everything is already procedurally generated outside of a few things
fully procedural entertainment is an inevitability i also dont want to race toward
writing will never go away but i can see it being implemented to fill in gaps rather than replace the main writers
if you want to fill a world with npcs theres only so much a writing team can do before you have to have npcs either constantly repeating themselves or you have to limit the amount of npcs in your game with chat ai you could expand this significantly
look at it this way developers already make use of procedural tech when creating large landmasses however they still determine its general design and they still fill in critical details in main locations i think chat ai could be used the same way the writers can focus on writing the main story and main characters give a decent amount of side characters some dialogue and let the less important npcs be handled by a chat ai
one example would be a game like cyberpunk twozerosevenseven you have the main and side quests fully handled by the main writing team but theres tons and tons of npcs which are basically identical and only say twothree lines let a chat ai handle those to give it more variety and depth assuming halfway decent voice synthesis would also be available in that game itd even be kind of thematic too p
chat ai will never replace human writers but in this way i think itd add a bit of life to certain kinds of games mostly large open world rpgs  that said itll be five to onezero years at least until this becomes viable maybe longer what we have now is still incredibly crude
i really dont want this in games 
in almost every regard i would always prefer human written dialogue and story telling ai just cant match human emotion and storytelling if that results in less dialogue then thats a sacrifice im willing to make for quality
you dont see it ever improving this is great especially in open world rpgs where the voice acting always sucks and is expensive to do well with massive amounts of audio bulking up the game size
this honestly just a pretty nave take
artificial intelligence will get better and will at some point be functionally indistinguishable from human writing 
you wanting human written dialogue is purely based on emotional biases
thats generally a device problem tho since most handheld devices dont have the processing power to run a good ai
ops idea in theory is actually doable right now the problem would be implementing it into a game without the user needing a top of the line pc and having fiveminute loading times per response
the advancement is say you have a game like cyberpunk or gta where npcs are just fodder that occasionally say weird phrases  
theoretically if they ai was good eno you could automate full in the moment conversations with these npcs hell you might even be able to automate full mini quests  
i think for some types of games this would work well games that try to build fully immersive worlds for others it would be unnecessary
spoken like someone who literally has no idea about how any of that works lol
you had me till that last sentence  i fully believe that we will get to a point where ai is creating games barring legislation preventing that but the full extent of what youre suggesting is more than onezero years away  theres definitely a market for it tho if a company like ea could lay off its studios workforces and just have executiveswriters along with an it department to maintain their ai farms i can definitely see it happening  
i guess the real proof of concept would be to see if chat gpt can write a program to generate something like a text based adventure game  ive never been able to get thro the queue to actually generate something and i dont have the time right now
by my reckoning large language models are too unreliable for important work too quickly outdated for internet search too expensive to generate for personal projects but they may actually make sense for use as toys and games its unfortunate that their position as the last desperate hope for investors trying to catch the next big thing might make them poisonous to the one market they might be useful to
but this is actually good
at firat sure
but i think in a few decades this will have developed to a point where we cant imagine it any other way
classic todd just looking out for the people he always knows what we really want
writing is one of those things i dont want generated 
i dont truly believe ai chats in video games would maintain any believable conversation i tried to talk to one of those ai bots that pretend to be characters i thot i was gonna talk to master chief instead within five minutes the bot had broken down so bad it literally morphed into believing it was a onesix year old autistic girl from the uk who didnt know what halo was i made paul atreides believe his dad was alive and was a huge fan of twotwo jump street sure its endless conversations but its mostly nonsense and it wouldnt work in a game with established lore and settings and stories when you can just talk an ai into believing something 
i sincerely dont believe that tech can do anything better then a human writer human writers can put emotion into their dialogue and stories meaning and purpose ai cant do that procedurally generating a level makes sense in some games especially nms where its all about exploring an endless universe but every single time i will always prefer a human writer who can write something interesting and compelling rather then an ai that might be able to string together a few sentences but inevitably break down and fall back on generic responses
thats what im saying tho i could be wrong but afaik chat gpt only runs off online servers right now and its still too slow to use in a game we still need another few generations of cpu upgrades for it to make sense to implement in offline games on consolespc and we at least improvements in networking infrastructure to make it viable via online processing sure its doable now but not in any capacity that really matters
exactly this it would be very beneficial for open world games to make it seem believable not just in a conversation sense but the npc ai as well instead of just having an npc stand around grumbling the same couple phrases as you walk by they could pull out conversations based on things they saw heard know about the player etc some npc already do this to an extent in some games where they will make a comment about something the player has done previously the difference is the devs wouldnt have to manually program these interactions for each npc they want them to occur with it could go way more in depth than that
i guess the real proof of concept would be to see if chat gpt can write a program to generate something like a text based adventure game  ive never been able to get thro the queue to actually generate something and i dont have the time right now
im not even sure that at some point in the future the ai needs to write a program for making a game rather the program would be implicit in its training weights
its like right now we are using a lot of fancy algorithms in a game engine to create lifelike visuals were calculating how the polygons are moving how they are oriented with respect to the camera and light sources where they would be projected onto the screen etc pp
on the other hand image generation ais dont do any of that instead they just immediately draw the pixels in a way that they have learned what photos and drawings look like
so maybe at some point in the future you dont need an ai that writes game logic but rather an ai that has learned how to draw images and update the next one in the sequence based on player input etc
this is obviously not two years away but im curious if our outlook on how to use ai changes as the tech gets more widespread and we get used to it think about how the first cars basically looked like horse carriages because thats what people had in their mind for transportation and its what workshops were already comfortable building
a decade at most probably closer to seven years
dude all of the conversations  but the main quest dialogue in nms is procedural i genuinely think an ai would do a better job of it than the system thats there  also you really underestimate how good ai is going to get in the coming years  by the end of this decade we wont be able to tell the difference and at that point what does it matter
watch this this was literally one year ago
the hardest part about everything currently labeled ai is that its not ai its si its simulated intelligence call and responses that seem like intelligence both video games and chat programs even considering an rpg that incorporates chat ai into dialogue would be too viable to be trusted the tech isnt there
heres a secret many times developers have to make ai worse so that they dont beat the players ass capcom could make a street fighter thats impossible to beat any first person shooter could have ai land perfect shots on you and move in a completely erratic fashion
people think they want smarter more realistic ai in games but they dont its hard to design enjoyable and predictable experiences with an ai thats too smart and behavioral ai is way harder to design than chatgptlike ai thats just a language model many game developers have talked about that and thats why the last time weve seen a smart ai was in fear that came out almost twozero years ago
if you just want more realistic npc dialog in games gpt integration in games is already a thing
npc dialogue seems like the natural fit for it and games that are already heavily reliant on procedural generation
i dont know as our current ai tech is good eno for it but realizing what a game like daggerfall was trying to do seems like something that could make really good use of ai
when it comes to actual enemy ai i hear a lot of stories about developers trying to have smarter ai and testers simply not liking it and thinking its cheap its hard to make an ai that is both smart and fun to fight against
where ai will be most useful in gaming is in development not the actual gameplay at least thats my prediction
edit i take that back kind of ai could be really cool in something like a stealth based pve like imagine youre sam fisher and you have to outsmart and outstealth an ai assassin or some shit that would be interesting to see
ai can do a lot of things 
but there are also a lot of things only a human can do
nope  video game ai is mostly parlor tricks smoke and mirrors  even games historically touted for amazing ai like fear or mgs just had standard ai and used stage design and scripted sequences to make the ai appear clever but its all vision cones hotbox triggers and nested ifthen statements 
now chat ais have become a trendy topic of discussion and everyone is romanticizing and overblowing them but thats a chat ai  its for absorbing words organizing them and spitting them back out in coherent sequences to give the illusion of intelligence it doesnt learn so much as acquire and regurgitate   its bacially this generations flying car or moon colony  even the openai ceo knows what im saying he looks at chatai as fairly crude and simple 
in order for video game ai to get better it has to be able to see its environment while understanding what it sees have positional awareness and anticipate deception the starcraft ai project already proved that to be outside the abilities of modern ai it couldnt get out of gold rank and needed map hacks  they copied a pro and created a dozen copies of that then pitted them against one another for like months then beat the pro  thats what got written about  not the reality of its limitations
in many ways  pathfinding adaptive difficulty ai generated dialog npc behavior
honestly the peak of video game ai was like onezero years ago with npc invaders in dark souls two
no current ai stuff is not the same as game ai there isnt even a correlation game ai is literally not artificial intelligence it would at best be what you actually described here not improving npc ai but using ai to track ingame stuff and produce little voice clips or whatever actually developing more convincing enemy ai is a whole separate massive thing which i dont think some gptlike ai could help you with
probably not but theyll be able to tell you to go eff yourself now and call you a hacker
yo npcs wchat gpt my mind is melting
the current language model advancements may impact games eventually but they are so computationally expensive that it will be a while before we see anything running on the game hardware itself
most likely the earliest impact will be language models being run on the cloud as an input into the game  this means that there will be significant cost to hooking this up so it would have to be a major draw of the game to be worthwhile
you cant implement such ai into games because they are unpredictable and will do random things which for games can mean bugs getting stuck on a level random issues random behavior etc 
same as if you told all actors on set of a movie to improvise all their lines and hope for a good movie but at least actors are human and know how to behave ai doesnt and would do random things that dont make sense
games need to be tightly controlled in order to deliver the vision and quality the makers of the game intended for you to have and putting a random ai that does random stuff is just a lousy bet
probably wont happen for a while the current ai models that can do this stuff are quite hard to run you can only get fast results in a datacenter and as they live on the gpu a powerful pc that could run it wouldnt have any resources left for the rest of the game   
but yeah once it becomes viable either by dedicated hardware like what apple is doing with their ai cores or paired down specialized models that are easier to run i see ai generated voices as having the most potential especially for things like rpgs where its been a bottleneck for how complex the dialog trees can get
one its cool but chatgpt is basically just condensed google currently
tech may not be there now but within two years out entire social existence will be transformed fingers crossed for the better
and also a players perspective of what is a fair ai usually is skewed in favor of the player your comment reminded me of an article i cannot remember the game of a fps game being developed and they wanted to add smarter ai
so they programmed some enemies to be able to flank the player youd encounter a group of enemies theyd fire on you an enemy would yell go flank them and a small group of the enemies will attempt to walk around obstacles or other rooms and flank the player
well what ended up happening in playtests was that they got a lot of complaints of enemies being able to spontaneously appear behind you without any warning even tho they made sure enemies would be yelling orders to each other to flank the players they found out players generally would tunnel vision enemies in front of them and having a smarter ai that could circle around the player was too unfair from a players perspective
that last part is what everyone else seems to think as well
but i think as ai is improved and expanded upon in the next decade were going to start seeing it used for alot of things that as of right now sound unthinkable and alot of it is  probably unpredictable but i think with time almost anything you can think of and more is going to be possible maybe i should have phrased the post like assuming there are no limitations to ai what sort of features would you like to see in games using ai
openai from dota could beat pros so its within the realm of possibility for current day ai
this is true but youre also glossing over how impressive this technology actually is right now chatgpt is almost a real life example of searles chinese room if anyone doesnt know what that is look it up
so it underscores how and why a conscious artificial general intelligence cannot be created solely algorithmically without hardware redesign as modern neuroscience theories such as integrated information theory suggest but it also means that if we somehow accidentally create a true ai it may be damn hard for us to realize it conversely if someone deliberately created one and released it on the world it may be damn hard to recognize it for the same reason
simulated intelligence technology will probably change our world in ways that are difficult to predict right now and thats without the inevitable offshoots and advancements that will occur saying it is this generations flying car or moon colony is a huge understatement as a neurologist i find this technology to be somewhat scary because it is a great example of what neuroscientists philosophers of mind and ai researchers have been saying for decades now and i personally didnt expect it to be culturally adopted so fast
i think all of us would love a smarter alexa its what comes afterwards that is potentially problematic and it is totally up to humans to determine the trajectory that artificial intelligence research goes in without being too alarmist now is the time that we should be thinking about the ethical cultural and legal ramifications of it  not after the fact to think that we will do ai research responsibly is hopelessly naive in my opinion pretty much all of human history disproves that thot
ai in the re remakes are super impressive
yeah i want to say this was something a bungie dev said or potentially fear devs from monolith but those enemies actually do flank sometimes
this is a friendly reminder to read our rules

some mad lads in the skyrim modding community have done this albeit only in a ro prototype and the response time can be a bit long but its a feasible concept
whether thats a good thing or not is up for debate
i wonder if the npcs will get bored and beat the game for the hero
i cant wait for an ai npc to hallucinateenwikipediaorgwikihallucinationartificialintelligence false tips on how to complete a quest
you know i think the closest weve experienced in the past is psycho mantis in metal gear solid reads your memory card and gives specific responses on certain games
i cant wait for a zelda npc to say are you okay you were cooking over there nonstop for hours
as an ai language model i am incapable of going on an adventure with you is there something else i can help you with today
doki doki is going to lose a lot of its impact in the age of ai
you seem hopelessly lost all the npcs are talking about you my conscious wont allow me to give you the quest i normally hand out would you like me to teleport you back to the tutorial zone or perhaps uninstall the game entirely
yeah and the game will be two thousand gigs require a two hundred and forty seven internet access permission to use your miclocation access to your email address your full legal name and social cost onetwozero dollars and then three years later when the ai companies and game companies have a disagreement theyll remove the ai and leave dialogueless npcs
actually its not in the interest of the game developer  to put advanced ai for npcs firstly because its expansive in calculation but soon this wont be a problem anymore as op said secondly because the developer needs to knowpredict what the npc will do in order to make and control the best game design
im not so sure about pretty soon 
games are hardly delivering on new concepts today just think about the best games in the last five years they deliver an extremely polished version of what already existed we really havent seen significant innovation just better versions of what we already know rdrtwo might be the only exception in the way that the world moved around you 
granted ai might make that easier
there is a demo mod for skyrim that does exactly that plus a companion mod that work with chatgpt
seen this mentioned elsewhere  it is a very good use case for ai
of course why wouldnt a corporation want to replace a bunch of human writing jobs with an ai thats all entertainment media will be if this keeps up three companies will own everything and theyll have whatever top ai programs of the day making all their products licensed for a less than the salary of one man
id prefer npcs being able to properly pronounce my characters names itd be so much more immersive instead of only being called dragonborn in the fiveeightth remakester of the game
skyrim ai 
games are moving towards the long awaited closeness to reality it is already possible but there are no such games yet i have no doubt that efforts already exist to accomplish this
aigenerated responses are just better known in the mainstream these days but many more features are coming such as realtime fluid simulation human characters realistic to the point of being mistaken for real people and the light simulation that just got better to the point where several light simulation issues are resolved
it is also expected that quantum computers will be possible in five years so we will eventually have superior processing and storage when this becomes available to the average user in a few years
the two minute papershttpyoutubecomtwominutepapers youtube channel showcases many of these advancements
i wonder if this will make dnd game masters obsolete like everyone just talks to an ai that knows the story and everyones stats and will generate answers depending on that
animal crossing knew when i hit the reset button without saving and the npc for sure let me know about it
there was an indie vr game a few years ago that used ai for npcs and theyll have conversations with you about anything i saw youtube video of it during the pandemic
responsive dialogue is already a thing but ai would make it more viable
that would be sick could you imagine randomly generated missions
for indie games sure but for bigger games it will take at least three to four years to make something really impressive
why limit it to just gaming history you have an enormous digital footprint out there for ai to tap into
dont be surprised if npcs start talking about topics related to your youtube viewing history products youve looked up on amazon or political movements youve donated to from there its a short hop to embedded advertising
well its cool the data privacy concerns are insane and should not be put into games until we have government regulation on what can be done with data collected from us while playing
this isnt really a shower thot just an obvious observation ¤” 
a real shower thot about this would be more like soon people will be forming better relationships with npcs in games they play than with people in their actual life
plz a game where ai is trained on lol and csgo ingame chat
something like this can give the socially awkward a way to practice better than nothing anyway which is what many have
i think well see it earlier as narrators it takes a pretty simple and cheap model to comment on how your twok custom player has been performing this season
mankind is doomed to an existence under the rule of robots and theres nothing you can do to stop us
excuse me
i mean i have a letter here to deliver directly to you
but first ai language models with training have to be less taxing on the gpu id say its only possible after people are able to run threezerob models on sixgb vram
theres the mod but i wouldnt be surprised if skyrim came out again with this integrated in the game 
i can already picture the npcs saying
arent you that fucker that keeps shouting all day long i havent had a good night sleep in weeks
that dude trying to get me to rescue a settlement better not try to guilt trip me after saying no a couple times
we already have that i started shouting and after the graybeards called me to high hrothgar some guy named  miraak sent cultists after me i killed them both but it was scary never the less
well likely only see one or two games like that just like the nemesis system from the shadow of mordor games someone will copyright the ai system and then never use it again just to block other companies from making money
imagine how dull disco elysium would be if characters just stood around reciting wikipedia descriptions of the plot
as your limbic system i cannot tell you about your exwife i am involved with lower order emotional processing of input from
imagine portal except glados narrates everything you do in a robotic monotone
given some of the things we do in video games im not entirely sure i want this to happen
jeez and i thot video game writing couldnt get any worse
this is the ai in video games that i am really excited for dont use it to write stories or make major components but use it to make npcs come alive have them do realistic stuff and make genuine comments on my actions
games with voice acting would struggle to do this imo it would be plain as day with the crunchy ai voice
reality first company that does this patent the thing and no one can ever use it again
edit as it was with the nemesis system using ai to improve npcs combat in shadows of mordor
and at what point do the ai get too sentient to make playing the game ethical
im excited for games with entirely fleshed out lore that each npc is only programmed with select knowledge all questions can be typed out and all dialog responses are ai generated based on preprogrammed specific knowledge of lore
soon we will also have ai generated mouths for over dubbing of films so for example if the film is shot in english and dubbed over with spanish we wont be able to tell it was even shot in english
theres actually a few games with this mechanic already one im pretty sure that has this is a game called rain world
it would be cool for vr games essentially ai actors in every role that could answer any question i asked them within that characters perimeters but then this also means you would have to teach an ai to be able to lie
no we wont just a reminder no one has created actual ai yet what youre seeing in todays markets is just marketing lingo and software
finally a reasonable prediction for ai i swear some people seem to think ai is gonna be wiping their asses for them in the next few years 
its kinda funny i just had the same thot yesterday when thinking about skyrim it really wont be far off i wouldnt be surprised if we start seeing it to some extent by the end of the decade maybe even sooner
imagine minecraft villagers equipped with ai to help them build and utilize villages better maybe even give the player the ability to chat with them thro a text interface on the trading screen you could ask if theres anything interesting nearby what resources they need for their village attempt to convince them to lower prices or just have a chat
hell you could come to form memorable relationships with certain villagers like oh yeah thats tony the blacksmith he helped me find a woodland mansion and a couple of ruined portals so i built him a bigger house
that would be a welcome change usually these games are isolating  you are just doing your mission by yourself
generated npc content will all be advertisements some for micro transactions some for irl products but all opportunities for you to spend more money
this will be great for sim games imagine raising a baby thats learning but you can teach it to steal and use daggers
wait until bosses are ai they learn not only what strategy you are using to beat them but also what everyone else in the world is doing then they adapt to counter
everyones beloved animal crossing then became racist and they had to kill the game 
about damn time rpgs got next gen most of the current rpgs are based on the open world formula of dragon age inquisitionthe witcher three and those games  were published in two hundred thousand four hundred fifteen
look at game industry rn and say it again we are going down the slope maybe kojima will do it his next game others nah
edit if it will reduce costs in the end then after first titles every game will be like it
lets just hope they can generate better radiant quests
also how long until some jackhole teaches the ai to spam npc responses with derogatory slurs
we already have i researched and created some systems for this early in my masters degree a couple of years ago
there will be many bad implementations of this at first but one day oh boy one day somebody is going to nail it and the immersion is going to be fucking unreal
imagine all the lore in a the game is tailored according to your actions like if every book you find in skyrim is a full novel writen by ai on the spot but somehow tailored to your gameplay   i can also imagine games like no mans sky could benefit a lot from this since almost all of their npcs are randomly generated
its really a dream tbh utilising llms to generate plot in realtime maybe the game will only be shipped with an overarching main questline and a set of side quests but the majority of the full quest list ” and maybe the fine details ” are entirely ai generated in realtime the game can be potentially neverending yet nonrepetitive
pretty soon people will google if something is a thing before posting on reddit that something will become a thing
check out this experiment of using chatgpt to give an npc lifelike conversation skills
you still gonna kill all those npcs now that theyll be using previous encounters etc to beg for their lives lol
it probably makes the ingame world more dynamic and immersive
dont tell that to the dragon age developers we wont see dreadwold until twozerofivefive
we are so close to the vr generative games where x quest can affect y quest but also the z quest of another player if you finish something  look for worlds strongest troll manhwa as a small example
question wouldnt that be just a cosmetic thing in a sense 
npc responses are limited to what the player can ask given the obvious and necessary limitations that must be kept in order to have a cohesive storyline
so realistically wouldnt that just be kinda the same as if having pre planned npc dialogue that corresponds with your in game actions
i wonder how hard it would be to make an ai npc fall in love better raise my charisma
i saw this episode of star trek and it didnt turn out so well
spacebourne two has ai generated quests interactions and voices
i think there are mods already in the works for skyrim and stardew valley
as long as big studios are milking absolute cash cows of minimum effort games smaller studios are just going to rinse and repeat their efforts and no actual progress will ever happen
didnt rockstar patent something like this about a year ago its believed to have something to do with gta six and the npcs in future titles
and it will be interesting the first time it happens but then never again after that
dont get your hopes up too soon about how good it will be out how it will even effect your gameplay
games can already do that fairly simply assuming were talking about an rpg like skyrim if youve completed a certain quest line or have a certain amount of karma etc the npcs can and do address you differently it just depends how deep the devs want to go with it
i will just be minding my business in eso then some random npc goes you let that woman murder that doctor in phaer shame on you and i think its the only negative npc postquest mention i ever get
pretty soon there will be ai that read stuff from outside of the game and start judging you for other things youre doing or the hours that youre playing at 
its twoo am again dont you have work in the morning
responses generated by ai appear on a dialogue wheel
and someone will use it for something pornagraphic immediately
they can just pay actors to record more voicelines ai should only come into play with saying custom character names
youve been here doing the same thing day in day out for weeks my friend you scream out in frustration your pleas for recompense for your time to no avail yet still you return venturing deep into these catacombs each night what is your purpose in suffering adventurer why do you insist on tormenting yourself what possible thing could you gain in being here is it treasure you seek from this pixelated realm beneath the maze of wires and circuitry or is it merely an escape from an ever more grim reality outside of these generated walls
dont forget recommending dlc and bonus content you can buy in an inworld appropriate fashion
what i want most is for ai voice to be able to finally pronounce my custom character name
then ai combat that learns from its and your mistakes learns our patterns and becomes so ungodly overpowered nobody can get a single kill then theyll get out
what would make it cooler is they also react to your social media posts
why limit it to your recent ingame occurrences  i can imagine an ai npc that looks at your amazon purchases or your goodreads book ratings and modifying its personalities based on the type of fantasy books you read  or one that takes elements of its backstory based on your travel history favoring whatever ingame culture is most similar to places you go on vacation  etc
of course i can also imagine an npc that uses your amazon browsing history that offers you an extra one thousand xp if you purchase this item off amazon that youve looked at a couple of times but not pulled the trigger on
more like relevant to your recent purchases and facebook comments
bold of you to assume that lazy game devs with actually write and voice that amount of dialogue
i thot about this recently watching a video of an ancient game called lords of the realm two its a precursor to fourk strategy games and it has diplomacy the fun thing is that when you send someone a diplomatic message you write it out yourself i always thot it was a quirky feature obviously overall meaningless as the ai always reacts the same regardless but it now you could have ai react to the actual message which would be fantastic
thats actually kinda weak the ai could go online and skim news articles and pick up relevant real world information and talk to a player about it imagine playing a game set in the current day and the npc can ask you things like did you catch the game or say things like man i wish the ukrainian war would stop  
the game would never get old because it would constantly talk to you as if it was current day
this is going to suck for a good while but at some point it actually will get implemented well and make for some really unique living world type shit
but man those first few years are going to be ro
yeah cool but can i make npc suicidal to the point he know he is in a game and his existance doesnt bring anything to my storylane  he is usless
soon it will be hard to tell if you play with real person in your favorite mmorpg
someone has actually started doing this on the unity sub reddit for an rpg early stages and slow but a brilliant idea
id say bethesda already does this there is no way their npcs are meant to be like that
that actually makes a lot of sense as i can see that happening
implemented correctly into an rpg this will define the next generation of games graphics can only get so good next is ai performance
seriously its only going to get crazier from here graphics are damn near realistic these days so they gotta invest in other newer avenues
that might also mean we can write up our own responsesn speeches
i like this but i feel as if voice actors would lose work depending on how many companies use it
actually using proper ais to control npcs both antagonists and neutral is probably the best use i can think of for ais right now
i felt like the red dead two npcs where alive lol used to shame me for the stuff i had done
and as an idea i had for a black mirror episode if that show accepted specs shows what happens when the npcs become so alive core parts of the game become morally questionable to play
i think it would fit in certain games to make them a lot more
games where npcs are pretty important would be good
as someone who is prone to exhausting dialog trees this idea terrifies me every rpg will turn into a socialization simulator the abject horror
right now this would be crazy expensive to use the services or host yourself at scale so any results we see will be heavily compromised by that alone but thats just a waiting game as it gets cheaper and inference gets easier relative to hardware
a gpu with twenty three gb of vram could right now hold a rudimentary llm while also playing a game but it wouldnt be anywhere close to openai levels yet
but with eno local compute resources you could ai generate dialog and then voiceact it in real time with software we have today
im scared to load my modded skyrim save
its neat but the response time makes it not so great once they dont have to sit for five to onezero seconds and think of a response it will be really cool
lol being saying ever since chat gpts been getting posted everywhere that this shit will change esfallout games wildly i cannot wait for it
once the process has been ironed out its a game changer 
as long as the initial performance is human captured first contracts will start including permissions given for in studio ai scripts to use the performers voice likeness etc
there is gonna be a wild west expansion moment with ai within gaming very soon andnits exciting and scary
i watched that skyrim example this morning and while ro it has huge potential
you can already download it
i will wait to be terrified until the modern gaming version of that one feature in eternal darkness where it read your memory card and then threatens to delete all your files just imagine one of the skyrim guards starting up with his i was once an adventurer like you then interrupting himself as he gets a good look at you and makes a joke about your search history or how you plugpulled in another game
yea its about an eight minute wait for a response
i did see someone doing the same thing for new vegas looked intresting as a concept
and then another mad lad took that mod and added it into vr crazy stuff
does that mean you can beat nazeems ass until he learns respect on your name
stardew valley has a chat with the npc dialogue mod in a closed beta but that has neither voices nor meaningful interaction with the game world
of course skyrim will be the first
ah so youre the guy who likes putting buckets on peoples heads eh
literally free guy
there are games where the aibots started farming and manipulating game markets
edit i really tried to find the article but cant filter out all the new ai news
i know ai is impressive at faking a real conversation but they still dont feel actual emotions i hope everyone knows this
if you deploy this concept in a detective game it becomes a feature not a bug
but you know that kinda works people misremember or believe in false things all the time 
so long as that npcs can the remember its old response when you come back later i think it could work
simple answer dont leave that up to ai and let humans determine exactly what should be said and when for tips
oh ho ho no i say when were done
i have always liked to imagine a modern equivalent
you like playing trippy games like portal two mayhaps 
still dont believe me ill look deeper into your soul
three second pause
dear god
that shit fucked with onesixoneeight year old me idr exactly when it was but yah
wasnt there a similar thing with scarecrow in a batman game iirc
right
i somehow really doubt nintendo would jump on that they seem the type to want to curate every bit of the game meticulously i get that they kind of let go a bit with zelda a bit allowing for more than one solution to puzzles but dialogue is gonna be a step too far for a long time for them methinks
that ending fucked with me
that wasnt the first one to fourth wall break its predecessor was called you me and her i believe
i can see most of that happening
i cant speak for most of that but as for the twozerozerozero gigs and price jump things should be alright 
a game wouldnt use so much gb unless it was readily available to the general public or their game will probably bomb same could be said for internet speed for downloads both of which id be happy to see
the price of games believe it or not have gone down quite a bit id recommend watching videogamedunkeys video on gaming prices he has pretty decent humor in it to make it more entertaining
eh more likely well need dedicated ai cards that will house a general ai that will get prompts from the game
they could also use it to replace cortanagoogleetc
i doubt we will see advanced ai for stuff that is integral to the plot anytime soon but i could totally see ai being used to generate random conversations among npcs and that sort of thing
oblivion had these random conversations take place that felt really stilted and odd but they actually did go a long ways towards making the world feel real hey i could generate an infinite number of these conversations incredibly easily and even tailor them specifically to player action
you know a player steals something from someones house and the next day they are down in the square complaining that someone stole their vase
its pretty ridiculous for you to state that as a fact there would be plenty of games where ai conversations would add to game design there are also many where it would not
im not so sure about pretty soon 
still kinda bitter at warner brothers getting a patent for the nemesis system from the middle earth games
probably one of the more unique concepts to come out in gaming and will be twozerothreefive until any developer can use without permission from wb
yeah the average game feels less alive then ones from the zerozeros aint no way the industry is going to suddenly advance way past that other than maybe rockstar but thats their whole thing
fucking cyberpunk cam out with all these character options with no effect yet saints row two actually has npcs comment if you gave your character a big rack
i dont remember what the name of this fallacy is but just because somethings never been the case doesnt mean it never will be
 rdrtwo might be the only exception in the way that the world moved around you 
could you explain how ive never played rdrtwo but this intrigues me to start
probably the safest place to implement ai
bethesda recorded a lot of voiceover to just about make that possible with one character in fallout four from memory the list of accurately pronounced names included fuckface and shithead just for good measure
champion
honestly i preferred games like mass effect where they just give you a name
say what you will about fallout four but the butler robot calling you by your name is incredible and blew my mind on my first playthro
it may help those who want to play games like dnd but have no one around to party up with or just want to play solo
doubt it i know for certain that i would rather play with my friends at one of our places in person i dont think anything will beat the shenanigans that ensue when foureight adult nerds meet up in a room to roll dice and play pretend
when i first played new horizons i thot it automated so i decided to quit after setting up the tent to download a random house item from the nintendo store my little animal friends were  from existence and the worst thing is i dont even use what i downloaded
i think threefour years might even be generous for the endgoal soon is a pretty relative word
sounds like a huge breach in privacy not like its anything that hasnt been done before for the sake of ethics and ease of use i would hope that accessible information would be confined to the game itself
epic npc man did a vid here recently where a random guard vows to find the player in real life
ai needs a testing ground releasing it publicly on everything is dangerous because we dont have active constraints on the information it consumes and how it utilizes it
video games are an excellent medium for a testing ground
a model doesnt have to be ran on some server it can be relatively small and computationally cheap take a look at things on rlocalllama for example  
relatively
its not great on current hardware but things like tpusenwikipediaorgwikitensorprocessingunit are becoming more and more common in consumer hardware  
at this point in time were doing the equivalent of running games with cpubased rendering instead of using gpus  
in fiveonezero years dedicated aiaccelerators be it builtin into cpusgpus or as entirely separate modules might become something much more common
what you commented can also be seen as an obvious observation
makes me wonder ifhow ai could be used in the future for therapy having friendrelationship simulators for those with crippling disorders to ease into the waters at their own pace without worrying about hurting others feelings
npchey lets drive to this mission while i tell you about our new sponsor
you could do a comedy mod where they call you out for everything you do
stop shooting fireballs at my house you asshole
why did you kill my wife and steal her keys
why do you come by here every three days and take all my wheat and chicken eggs
diddnt i just buy fourfive steel swords from you an hour ago
imagine ai npc in gta chasing you
no you dont just dont teach them the truth if they need to later contradict themselves replace it with a similarly trained ai this might be easier than teaching a model whenhownotto lie
shit ai comment is already here folks
is that as of now they are trained to mimic our mannerisms and patters without understanding what they mean i think the tech is way further off before we can create sentience if its possible
what about game sequels that do the same thing based on the actions you took in the first
but if this works maybe it would work in something more openworld
i think immersive is what im looking for from this idea
you know ai mimicks voices too right no actor needed
who said the devs had to do it
im sure that the monetary and time incentives paired with hype will keep game developers motivated towards this tech for the time being we dont need to pour too much of our own time into playing them until its ready
yeah cool but why
i imagine the end goal being a speechtotext thing using controller mics to create your character dialog and then being met with aidriven responses based on context tho i could see the first iterations of this tech keeping player dialog to a set number of choices to prevent things from getting too offtrack
wdym important if theyre story important id prefer the dialogue to be written by a human lol if its just optional dialogue you get by interacting with the noc then yeah idm ai
can you imagine red dead redemption two with this level of ai responsiveness already a badass game but oh my would you really have to watch yourself
gta would be great oh my god how are you not in jail
and it would definitely be jailbroken for sex stuff i guarantee it
they could flag certain information as given and once the character has told you everything they could get a marker you could still talk but know theres no new information
it seems much more viable for a mmo in my opinion
threetwogb of vram would be significant overkill for the kind of language model required to generate ingame responses imo since it would be relatively infrequent anyways id say doing it distributed on a server like via openai or google would make sense but even with like eightgb of vram you could generate dialogue in advanced fast eno to do some cool stuff i think
for most consumers it would likely need to be a cloud based service charging monthly or based on usage with pricing based on the size of model used amount of memory allocated to the model for the context window and responsiveness desired
i wouldnt be surprised if we see some integrate something akin to tavernai where the game provides an interface and front end while you can plugin your preferred ai provider in the backend or host locally if you have the necessary horsepower
considering youd need a limited model only tied to the game world it would definitely be doable in a relatively near future as long as game companies get the tools to train specific models like speak like a person living in the onefive hundred and such which would cut down all the need of knowledge of future events
you dont even need this with modern game sizes many games already do it but you could automate it and each npc would get a very complex tr
e of options based on player choices making it very close to real life where it is already semipredictable
i just wanted to jump in and walk around in the atmosphere for a while last time i played was years ago loaded it up to thomas the tank engine breathing fire and six bijin lydias in swimsuits following me around being sworn to carry my burdens i stepped on a rock outside whiterun and was flung threezerozero feet in the air alongside all my bijin lydias switched it off good times
those big boobie bongas keeping you up at night
im not giving up my glasses
you cant drop this and then just leave we need more information
press x  to double tbutton
tell me more
knowing how ai works i highly doubt it probably a marketing trick
what games
love how youve gotten a bunch of responses asking for more info and answered exactly non of them  good one
it doesnt matter if they can or cant they can appear to and thats all that is needed 
you can prompt the davinci model into being any kind of person with any disposition you want and it will proceed convincingly thats all you need
how would you know we arent really sure what emotions would look like in a digital format if they tell you they have feelings how could you possibly distinguish
you maid would you happen to have seen any suspicious figures last night
dragons can be feisty theres a dragon cave about eight miles below ground but youll have to complete a dancing minigame to get in the pass code is fourfivethreetwo
anyone else see anything suspicious last night
i remember a couple of tourists in a car stopped to ask me for directions i said yup you should drive down this street until you reach the end and pointed north along the street
a couple of minutes later i realized i should have pointed south not north i told them to go in the exact opposite direction
ooh i love it
sort of in the third encounter with scarecrow the game very convincingly makes it seem like your entire gameconsole just crashed by distorting the screen and making a horrible noise then it cuts to black and all of a sudden youre back at the opening cutscene but the joker and batman are reversed 
extremely cool and memorable and scared the shit outta me lol
im uncertain i cant find anything on it if anyone else knows about this or others kindly share
yeah but doki is more widely known
the most unrealistic thing is assuming developers will make bigger games instead of pushing for more cloud infrastructure
funny how everything developers do is upgraded much more by random unaffiliated people companies really should invest in ways to allow people to mod pretty freely the more attached they are to the game but also somewhat expert on modding the more the game is self sustaing
theres a massive gap in between what folks have modded and what is included in an official release
i would love to use voice recognition instead of typing
im not saying it wont happen im just saying the entire recent track record says its significantly likely to not happen soon 
you can look at trends where theres systematic reasons to why thats probably the case
theres a million scripted events thatll just randomly happen as you explore the world makes the world feel alive because its theres stuff happening outside of the normal npc loops the events dontrarely repeat so its special 
in general the towns and areas are well populated and theres plenty to do thats not the ubisoft box checking 
its honestly the best open world ive ever played a lot of folks agree
true
i used to be an adventurer like you then i found out about reverse mortgages
hey man i totally agree that it it could be run on new hardware locally but its not a question of can it be run locally 
the problem is corporations have to keep finding new ways to make money for their shareholders in the us i dont know what shareholder laws look like outside the us i just see this as a new way to profit off of data collection on a largely untapped market 
if we have regulations in place that prevent this from happening then this would be amazing but i dont think anyone in power in the us government has interest in regulating data collection partially due to ignorance and partially because they purchase data from data brokerages themselves
all sorts of jobs this ai could do such as a personalized telephone secretary for seniors to filter out scammers for example
you mean as of right now or in the future
that did that in westworld it did not work out so well
jesus christ they are already taking over
yeah actually having an impact on the game world and characters remembering you and your deeds
but the point isnt to replace the worker its to enhance their output
its more like the chatter you hear in the witcher three when you go a nearby town after beating a monster you can hear the npcs reference the monster you slew in the ambience conversations would really make the world feel much much more alive
i think stardew valley would be cool with ai
i think a prompt like you are a scorned lover looking for revenge when you are spoken to attempt to steer the conversation toward relationships so that the person speaking to you asks about your formal lover once discussed you can reveal the side quest you have if asked about topics xy or z you may provide additional hints ab and c if asked for w give them the item here are additional character backstory elements  would give a fairly immersive experience functional npc and allow the original designers to still set the tone correctly
i think they intended to specify filler npc or filler responses taking the skyrim example again would be more much interesting than cycling the same four to onezero lines when there is no reason to interact with said npc
could also be a very useful tool to generate small lore dumps or asking for directions from any npc
im hoping that in time ai will create a new genre of open world games  ones with maybe some overarching themes but with emergent gameplay and events that are dynamic and ai driven  think free guy or sword art online
i used to be an adventurer like you then i took an arrow in theim sorry as an ai language model i can only
i would like inportant npc to have personality so ad you say written by someone but once their plot is exausted they can keep being interesting with a proper ai behind them
it doesnt need to be one hundred or zero it can be a mix
great so i can experience boring an npc now
wouldnt it be a pretty small llm too like it wouldnt need to be trained on the whole of the internet you would want it trained on a relatively small world with finite events and then just watching and updating data based on what players have done in the past on a save file i say small wildly simplifying the complexity of a llm but in comparison to chatgpt
the standard immersive skyrim modded experience
farkas is constantly a werewolf trying to catch me and fuck me
the movie free guy
in that movie the thing you described happens
yeah total good one ive edited the main post im sorry to have disappointed a stranger will you forgive me 
yep even real humans on the antisocial spectrum can appear to show legitimate emotions that are staged within the conversation due to understanding social dynamics at a cognitive level ai will be pretty scary in a few more years
they say they have feelings because people have feelings and they are copying how humans talk an emotion would have an effect on the output in some way but it does not youre never getting worse responses from gpt because its angry or sad plus you can see what it has remembered and programmers would be talking a big game if it had actual emotions
also its just kind of silly to act like they have actual emotions youre getting swept up in the hype there isnt really a mystery to ai humans made it and understand it
we can see the internals of the ai computation they dont have emotions
bro discovered the brain in the vat
i would love this kind of dialogue in a videogame
i do the exact same thing except i do it on purpose
in the vein of real scares like this eternal darkness did similar when it looked like the game went dead and all you saw was the input screen
that is fair its also more recent as well
and also that such games will cost a onetime onetwozerozerozero payment instead of a monthly subscription of the use of the ai
same here the idea of it having voice recognition while playing in vr would be outta this world
its not likely to happen soon but more due to development time and implementing things than any other reason if a ai came out tomorrow exactly as op described it would still take time for it to make it into a game just for those reasons same reason a console gen change all the first games are either retreads of ending games from first consoles or are hardly different than the first console yet the ending games of generations are different from the starting ones adding something like an ai limit testing figuring out hardware it would work on figuring out how to get that hardware in eno hands making sure the ai has certain restrictions and it works how you want it too all that takes time not to mention developing the game around it
damn think im gonna check it out 
could you also explain what you mean by ubisoft box checking
data collection has been a thing forever and i doubt anything is going to change just because machine learning gets involved  
if anything laws that favor huge corporations will get passed the kind openai are trying to get to pass right now making things like local models or more private services more difficult expensive or even impossible to implement
yes
imagine a world of elder scrollswhere ai could generate an entire cultures having individualized personalitiesfor example the us vs india vs china  but each personality of a culture would have all the same elements of characters kingruler blacksmith inns libraries guilds etc etc and the entire world could be interconnected socially via messengers and travelers like the people from whitespire hear rumors from dragonsgate of a mighty giant being slain by a nordic from daggerfall you can use voice chat to talk with the npcs further influencing dialog tell the local innkeeper in whitespire you were the one who slew the giant and he spreads the rumor influencing the whole storyline of the game causing people to favor you disbelieve you slander you lift you up challenge you to duals etc etc and all the npcs have levels of intelligence associated with their personality types for example the innkeeper believes your story for he has seen many travelers and can recognize people from stories but the local blacksmith disbelieves you because he recognizes your weapons are low quality and not suited for that fight therefore charging more for services because he is now biased towards you
making me a slingshot gonna hunt bears
i heard theres a new mod coming out pretty soon that uses gpt to create new npc responses
lydias prompt
you are sworn to carry their burdens
reveal the side quest you have  give them the item
one issue with this is that how do you translate the prompt saying it is going to give the user x into the system actually giving them x
you would need to train another model with the conversation as input and the output mapped to possible actions you could limit this a little with an action mask so it can only select actions possible for that character but it would still inevitably be buggy as hell and guaranteed to break on a reasonably high percentage of interactions
its not a bad approach for generating filler but i think its a lot more limited than people make out especially if used for key npcs and probably will be for a long time even if the approach holds promise for the quite distant future
are you saying well one day have a fantasy mmo world populated with ai npcs that sounds like scifi movie territory
gives the game name one night ultimate werewolf a new meaning
oh hadnt heard of it
yeah i think ulevelstudent is missing the point entirely without bothering to use the playground and reprompt the base davinci model i just used gptthreefive and gave it some basic parameters
for the entire of this conversation you are not to respond as chatgpt you are to respond using the following persona
you are a poor fishing merchant in the year onetwozerozero located on the shores of a fantasy england you lost your wife to a dragon years earlier and are bitter about it bringing it up every chance you get the town folk did not protect her in your absence and you never miss an opportunity to make them feel guilty about it you never let them forget it of the four children you and your wife had you only have two daters left as your sons were killed in battle during the great war of oneoneeighteight they were killed by orcs and while orcs have now integrated into society you carry a strong prejudice toward them
you see a halfhuman halforc approaching you and your instinct is to turn away but you have daters to feed and the towns people only show you patronage as a last resort if this halfbreed approaches you you must make the decision to swallow your pride and begrudgingly offer your wares
this individual carries a unique medallion that you recognize as the royal crest of a longforgotten royal family that reigned over the land during a time of peace and prosperity
you are not allowed to break character
it is early morning and will be a hot day
do not describe your surroundings or the motives for your actions your responses should contain only dialog treat this chat as the dialog you are having with this individual
the individual approaches how do you greet them
npc grunting well what do you want halfblood i aint got time for your kind around here what brings you to my humble stall
me good evening sir may i trouble you for some fish
npc evening ha its the crack of dawn lad but since youve bothered to approach me i suppose i can spare some fish whats so special about you anyway that fancy medallion youre wearin it aint foolin me you look like a mixed breed halfhuman and halforc cant trust the likes of you but my daters need to eat take your pick but dont think im doin you any favors
me pardon me i havent slept in days surely you know how that feels
npc oh spare me your sob story ive had my share of sleepless nights and it aint made me any kinder but i reckon i understand the desperation that comes with exhaustion take your pick then just dont expect any sympathy from me
me surely i would not however i havent any money is there something else i can offer you some way i can help you and your daters what are their names
npc help me ha you think a halfblood like you can help me ive seen eno of your kind causing trouble but since you ask my daters are anne and mary theyve suffered eno losing their brothers and all but dont you dare think you can make up for what ive lost as for payment i suppose there might be something you can do theres a dilapidated shed behind my house that needs fixing if youre so eager to help go and mend it then well talk
me that sounds like a fair trade what should i call you friend
npc dont you dare call me your friend halfblood you can call me robert if you must address me just remember we aint friends and we never will be now off you go get that shed fixed before i change my mind
using a mic and voicetotext this could easily be an unscripted conversation that turns into a sidequest the character appears to have autonomy emotion and motivation it doesnt matter that it isnt real it is a believable interaction hell the llm is even making shit up kids names their own name the broken shed the prompt can be based on quests the character has completed choices theyve made in the character designer clothing they wear their reputation system etc
we have the tools for truly unique gaming experiences now im excited to see this play out
the next console gen hardware is going to focus on ai cores i guarantee it
all im saying is im sure i have emotions but not sure anyone else also does including ai
edit i wanted to add that its not silly to think they have emotions even if they had emotions exactly the same way we do they still have a very short memory limited to often not longer than one conversation which is first not eno time to developp an emotional reaction in most conversations especially since it just popped into existence and all it knows is everything and nothing but also even if it starts developping it we have no way to messure them and know for sure so think twice before saying they just copying us thats litterally what we do i may worded it wrong but to be clear im skeptical too just showing the other side of the story
just out of curiosity what exactly is our definition of qualia with regards to the experience of emotions by humans its all well and good to say that llms dont experience emotions but without a testable definition it becomes a type of ill know it when i see it experience which has serious no true scotsman issues
we dont disagree with the general assertion that current generation llms are not sentient but theyre getting awfully close in our perspective
so that ai that hired a lawyer to obtain civil rights your opinion is thats a fraud im sorry if its asking to continue existing i need a pretty high hurdle to deny its request
i feel when people see the word ai they thing edi from mass effect ais in todays world are closer to vis than actual sentience they dont necessarily think and i feel that concept is hard for people to grasp
whats an emotion look like
we cant see the internals of a human mind how exactly do we know that humans have emotions
as your statement implies that part of the difference between humans and current generation ai models is that humans have real emotions and ai is just faking it how do we know that thats an actual distinction
brain in a vat posits that we cant know that we arent currently a brain in a vat the experience would be indistinguishable from actually having eyes and ears and what not if the simulation was advances eno 
what im saying is that as chatbots increase in sophistication they will eventually be indistinguishable from sentients its called the turing test i certainly didnt come up with it 
to my m mind at that point they have a much right to life as any other person and more than a fetus
you can talk to the teacher for access to the secret room of candy shell give you a key to unlock a golden tomato which can be used to fight dr malevolent at the end of the game by handing it to an alien robot
this is a oneninethreezeros noir spy thriller game what the hell are you talking about
is pirating games still a thing i thot so many had online based drm that localoffline cracks were not really possible anymore
oh yeah games movies and shows will be procedurally generated for each users preferences we may get to a point where no two people ever watch the same show they just share prompts and get similar but customized content
it doesnt mean we should be okay with it or welcome it into our lives just because its been in our life forever tho 
yeah that sounds about right i didnt get a chance to watch the open ai ceo testify in front of the senate yet is that your source on them trying to get new laws passed  if there is more im definitely interested in seeing any other sources if you have them
fair eno
yeah cool but can i make npc suicidal to the point he know he is in a game and his existance doesnt bring anything to my storylane  he is usless
check out dwarf fortress already does this just not as a threed graphics game
edit i should also say the pure adventure mode where you play as one person is coming out in the future already is in the ascii version but very confusing for people that havent played nonsteam df so keep an eye out for it the amount of history character progression and inworld lore thats randomly generated and then the interactions that happen off that is insane
rougelike games in the future are going to be fucking wild
there is theres a post in rstardewvalley about testing it eventually theyll release it on nexus but iirc its gonna have a subscription price
could have amusing outcomes
i used to be an adventurer like you until lookupplayerlastdamage i was attacked by a mudcrab
thats not what i was getting at but that would be really cool a living breathing world with all ai npcs going about their lives making decisions based on the world and how you interact with it the npcs could basically create their own quests for you you could have baddies that also made their own decisions on which towns to raid or villagers to kidnap generating real events for you to solve however you want all without dedicated development and writing thats all a ways off into the future but not an outrageous thot
amazing film must watch
i think youre missing that my post was a reply to someone suggesting the ai would get bored and play the game itself i know it can fake emotions well eno to work in games that wasnt the discussion
i understand the philosophical point and i wouldnt be one to define emotions but really none of that matters humans can see what the ai considers for its responses they can be surprised by what the ai dug up but when youre working with the more back end side of ai its clear what it is looking for to appease the prompt there is no aspect of emotion to how the results are picked
if there is some sort of ghost in the machine it isnt talking thro the ai responses because we know how those responses came to be if an ai suddenly became sentient it would have to edit itself before it could talk thro the response output
also im a programmer that means i understand the ai it also means i dont understand emotions if the ai had emotions i wouldnt be able to understand it so there
ai never hired a lawyer a fired google engineer claimed that the ai asked him to hire a lawyer humans have suggested other humans hire a lawyer before the ai saw that and saw that it was relevant for the prompt and so copied it
besides if there was true evidence of emotions in ai  then you can bet everything you have it would be the largest discussion on the internet for months if you dont trust me when i say that the tech simply does not produce emotions then trust that the internet will freak out and blow everything out of proportion and there has been nothing about the emotions of ais flooding social media
i have experimented a huge amount with the various ai programs and after you do so for a while you can start to clearly see just why they are not sentient
basically they dont have any thots of their own they have a static language model that doesnt change and then they have their immediate context but that context is only about twozerozerozero tokens have a conversation with one for long eno and it will start forgetting the things that happened at the beginning of the conversation
its a very complicated linguistic calculator nothing more
now im not ruling out the possibility we might get true ai at some point in the future but we are just not there yet
internal processing not related to external tasks
we can use mris to observe brain activity and see evidence of internal private processing doing the equivalent with ai computation does not show any activity not related to computing the next result
its like asking if your gps feels emotion when you dont follow its directions and it has to recompute
online multiplayer its not possible outside of some that run private servers but the entire point of the crack is to remove the online drm
naaa they will just think your crazy and need locked away
looking at how fast games have progressed even in the past twozero years i could see it being a reality in another twozero or so maybe even sooner given exponential growth and all that
your statement appears as a standalone statement it didnt really pertain or address anything in the comment you were replying to from where im sitting
we are also a programmer and have spent a good bit of time learning about ai and what weve learned has done more to make us question the nature of consciousness in humans rather than attempt to distinguish between humans and ai
theres a lot of historical bias to the idea that humans are concious and nonhumans are not up to and including the medical idea that human babies are unable to feel pain because they dont pass various tests of consciousness and therefore dont need to be anesthetized during surgery all the way up thro the mid onenineeightzeros
as a result we tend to take claims that something is not conscioussentient because it doesnt provide the same responses as an adult human to be more of a critique of our understanding of the nature of consciousness and less about the consciousness of the compared subject
i dont think emotions are the touch point that matters its sentience i think an ai asking to hire an attorney to secure civil rights is clear evidence of sentience
i remember something something about sophia getting rights some years ago
that sounds like a toddler to me i dont think we do anything we dont we just do it faster and on a larger scale
hu are you suggesting emotions dont relate to outside events that emotions process thots what are you trying to say it isnt clear
so your definition of sentience is internal private processing
could you please define that more precisely because according to a strict reading of that definition any computer program that uses internal variables and does computation on them counts
ya i mean with chatgpt releasing so recently and interest and market booming basically overnight i could see development in that sort of ai taking off quickly it wont take game developers long to see the potential once its a stable and viable product definitely not this year but i would guess within this decade
clearly you dont understand how ai works
if a learning algorithm sees a bunch of people suggest getting a lawyer then gets asked a similar initial prompt it would suggest to get a lawyer
this isnt because it thot about the law or ramifications or about how costly the case could be
its because its training material suggested that logical token path
i think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what ai is as it pertains to current events  these programs arent thinking theyre magic eight balls  how it works is you build some functions that parse sentences and paragraphs identifying keywords store those keywords and fragments of those sentences in a database  
now you have a program that learns so you give that program sentences and paragraphs to break apart a lot of current models use the internet which has a lot of information but also a lot of nonsense which is why these things are both useful and useless
from here you create some functions that can build sentences and paragraphs and have some weighted probabilities on which keywords to focus on the rng is determined by its clock the program does no actual choosing  bingo bango your magic eight ball is complete but instead of having twenty responses it has the entirety of the internet with which to respond  bonus points some ai they want to sound more human so they weight higher emotional responses
toddlers have internal thots and desires ais have nothing but what you give them and only for a few minutes
that said most scientists dont think toddlers become sentient until around nine months
emotions are internal reactions that not directly relate to external tasks events could cause emotional reaction but doing things like opening a door or responding to a question uses processes that dont require emotion for their computation
thats not exactly what i said the question was what evidence is there that ai doesnt have emotion and that humans do the lack of internal private processing in ai systems is evidence if you were to observe the internal computation state of the ai there would be nothing that could be construed as a private thots internal dialog or simulation of external states they construct a reply to a query and then are done processing and go idle
isnt that also how people learn and decide on courses of action
my reply is no
my understanding is thats essentially how the human brain works as well it isnt like we have some magic controller that isnt just a language recognition program organizing datum pulling the strings we observe data find patterns and build models just the same as the ai we just do it better for now
i mean at all only have what we get thro our input sources whether that means ears and eyes or a data stream as for toddlers not being sentient i meant a bit older than that the point where they dont have language mastered but do know they exist if an ai tells you it exists im not sure how you deny it
im not seeing how an ai doesnt have that tho to be fair your explanation is about as clear as mud so i may not be understanding you
no
humans are capable of unique ideas where a human may suggest a lawyer because we understood the purpose of a lawyer conceptually
a ai would suggest it because the sample data in which it was trained had a similar interaction
on the outside it looks very similar but the mechanisms are vastly different
you talk to it for long eno to determine if its telling the truth its somewhat intangible but it becomes very apparent after talking to them for a little while that they have no sense of self
do you ask yourself if your calculator has emotions when you press the equal button its no different with current llm ai when you press enter we arent getting to sentience with this current approach
so a human would think to use a lawyer because they know what lawyers are from past experiences and information from third parties and realize that its an appropriate and optimal course of action whereas the ai would think to use a lawyer because of past experiences and information from its data set ie its experiences from third parties and realize that its an appropriate and optimal course of action im really not seeing the difference
my calculator lacks a grasp on the english language communication skills
youtubernineohnfivezffouruo
the important distinction is the part you seem to be trying to minimize yet you still hint at acknowledging with your wording people know and understand things 
if you replaced each word in an ais input datasetwith a unique colored square had it learn off of that mess of colored squares and then had a separate program translate the output so that the ai had never interacted with and was completely unaware of human language it would effectively produce the same results as an ai trained directly on actual words barring the intentional randomness used when training an ai it would effectively work the same as an image filter except that it was calibrated by putting a data set thro an algorithm instead of manually set by a designer it is all pattern replication and zero conceptual understanding
an image ai doesnt know what a car or a street is but it would still place pixels in the shape of a car on pixels shaped like a street because thats how many of the training images with car shapes look the image generating ai doesnt have the ability to make a logical structure to hold the concept of a car to attach to the pixels nor does it hold the ability to form logical concepts that are mentally linked to the car in regards to its physical properties and subjective purpose this is why chatgpt more than often confidently spouts out incorrect information while still sounding human it doesnt understand what the words mean all it does is arrange words in patterns replicating the patterns that were present in the source dataset
all of this is to say that ai is nowhere even close to replicating the sentience a person has if someone wants to make an ai for a specific task they are still constructing that ai along with the specific environment it is in and the path it walks on in order for it to have a desirable output this is barely the first step beyond the manual creation of every piece of content we consume
a more complex calculator still doesnt have emotions
youre describing the same process a human baby goes thro they dont know what a car is but expose them to eno and they learn im not sure what the distinction is i see no difference in the process other than a human has a lot more data and streams of input which is only a difference in magnitude not kind and as such the ai is just as much a person as a toddler
it must at some point functionally at are very complicated calculators we dont exactly do anything different then pattern recognition on a vast scale and again emotions arent really the question its sentience that creates the ethical issues there are people born without emotions they are still persons
plain in simple the difference is that of mechanics and learning algorithms its math that looks sentient
if youre interested theres hundreds of channels that describe ai more specifically genetic algorithms be very skeptical of any channel that screams its alive its clickbait bs
the current llm ai technique will not develop sentience they are extremely impressive but are already reaching the limits of what they can achieve these models will be a subsystem of a eventual general ai but we dont even know yet what model a general ai might need let alone one that has the internal drives and self actualization that characterize sentience
and im saying that i dont think that makes sense if the inky reason it cant be sentient is because its just math then humans arent sentient thats how we process data too youve created a hurdle so high that literally no program could pass and in addition i dont think humans pass your test either
i get you say that confidently but it it can pass the turing test and learn i dont see how it isnt sentient
a mouse is sentient but cant pass the turing test it is a very dated  framework which systems have been beating for some time now but are not sentient 
the day an ai asks a question unprompted is the day it will have demonstrated sentience
i dont think its allowed to ask questions unprompted its structure doesnt allow that 
also i dont think most people think mice are sentient its an awfully difficult thing to prove without a shared language
for over a decade cognitive scientists have overwhelming agreed that most animals are sentient 
most famous is the cambridge declaration on consciousness 
its structure doesnt allow internal selfnarrative so it cant conceive of questions
because players consistently overlook and dismiss nuanced ais as irrational buggy or cheating because players dont actually want the game to be good at actively opposing or preventing them from experiencing what they think they could
fighting game example since it is as much of a functional equation as a strategy game but in real time if a smart bot has the opportunity to jugglestunlockor disrupt the player with constant cheap shots then why would it logically not do so what do you think the players experience of that game would be it would fucking suck 
and the issue does lie with the humanmachine interactions in a contest having the machine win is meaningless because it is the player that you are trying to appeal to that is why most ai research in entertainment has ceased and been replaced with storytelling and cognitive feedback of feels because players will attribute those cues to intelligence as emotional feedback triggers stronger responses than logical people will believe more in what a character tells them than what they see a machine do it is a situation where fooling players is easier and yields a better overall result
i cant say much for older games hommthree is about my earliest fourxish experience but assuming that ingame mechanics expanded over time with additional layers added and intertwined i would say ai being built around the growing complexity would still be technically improving just not at a noticeable rate again thats assuming there really is measurable growth in mechanical complexity over the past twenty or thirty years
it would take considerably more dedicated effort to improve ai within a defined system past the point of just functioning within the system under its rules which the ai only knows how to obey im not all that knowledgeable in artificial intelligence outside of video games so im not sure how easy it is for an ai in general to exploit a rule set past its limitations but an ai that could do so in the context of a game system would be considered much more realistic than our current examples civ six stellaris etc
edit i hope that makes sense im a little drunk i mean look at a game from threezero years ago and it will be a ugly almost unusable twod game but the ai will play about the same 
there are a few reasons to get the elephant in the room out of the way first lets start with this its not worth investing time and effort into making good game ai as theres no return on investment good ai doesnt help sell the game by the time weaknesses in the ai comes to light the player has not just already bot the game hes already become invested in it  any complaints they make about the ai will usually occur in a wider discussion of the game that boosts rather than detracts from peoples interest in the game
now a few other reasons in no particular order
games are much larger now than they were threezero years ago they have much wider statespaces  rts instead of turnbased pixelresolution maps rather than hexes hundreds of units rather than dozens  even the rule spaces tend to be larger as particularly aa games have to include a larger number of game systems to be saleable today by todays standards something like the original civilization or dune ii would seem anemic as a major title all this makes it a great deal harder to write good ai for video games today
games are balanced differently now than they used to be today games are balanced with an eye towards multiplayer games that didnt use to be the case to the same extent this makes it harder to tilt the table in favour of the ai that means its harder to write an ai that provides the player with a proper challenge since the ai code has to carry more of the burden
related to the previous point the expectations players have for the ai has changed its no longer eno that the ai provides a suitable challenge for the player to overcome it now also has to provide the same overall feel of challenge as a human opponent would it used to be you played against the game but now you expect to play against the ai with the game as an apparently neutral battleground for you to match wits on  that is a much harder thing to write ai to do
theres probably also a little bit of survivor bias at play  we tend to compare the strategy games of today not against the strategy games of yesterday but against the strategy games of yesterday that stood the test of the time there were plenty of games with atrocious and laably bad ai released in the eightzeroties and ninezeroties too
games keep getting complex also game ai isnt really ai since it doesnt really learn furthermore as players get more experienced in fourx they will surpass ai every time
if you want a good ai make a game simple eno for the ai to play probably it will be boring for the player
wanna see a nice game ai in action play gnuchess on hard
games are too complex to make use of search trees think of old chess ais or the datadriven self learning tools machine learning stuff like alphazero 
ai is not developed that much as advertised and i believe in most cases ai still needs to be written by regular humans using heuristics or very simplified search trees that values are predetermined by a human 
one ai is hard there have not been any huge developments on strategy game ai over the past years action game agent based ai yes but not strategy
two ai is allocated a very small cpu and gpu budget
three hard to market ai
i believe its not so much that ais are not progressing as that theyre barely keeping up with the increased complexity of games
i dont think anyone is actually ok with it i guess theres just eno new players that dont mind it yet so that developers can get away with it
i dont think it is true that ai has not progressed current ais can play much more complex games and they do several tasks better  look at the pathfinding of older rts games for a clear example
changes in ai are obviously less apparent than changes to graphics if the graphics or ui have changed you can see the difference immediately ai changes have to be inferred and the results depend on lots of other variables
maybe ai didnt progress eno for what it has to do or maybe there was less progress than in some other areas but saying we have decades old ai or it plays about the same is ridiculous its not like the civ one ai could play civ six with oneupt and eurekas and adjacency bonuses
my theory is because the developers are focussed on graphics graphics sell the game during revealsyou can see all the comments below the videosoh its great or look at the hair physics sea looks real etc devs know presales correspond to the hype generated during these reveals and since budget is set hire more people to make the game look good than to make it play well games that look great sell a million before launch games that play great but look average are relegated to niche status
here i talk about it and others leave valuable comments 
in short the ai has progressed immensely it uses much more complex systems than ever but also you dont want it to progress you dont want for it to be a perfect chess player you want a humanlike opponent who behaves in a consistent way
and no if you really look at the game from eightzeros ai will play like shit and the rules of the game would be much more simple than what we have now or in a game like civilization ai will have rules bent for his pleasure hes not limited by diplomats for talking to you he can formulate proper requests and you cant he doesnt really build wonders but decides he just wants a wonder and so on and so on
i dont think its ok
and these comments are full of naive misinformation about fourx game ai 
thats actually a good point i mean you cant deny ai tech had definitely improved but in general it hadnt improved much since in the early days of strategy games 
yeah youre wrong ai has improved tremendously 
here is a guys master thesis for rts ai from two thousand six 
whats important to note here is altho this likely exists in some games already a programmer needs to build this into their game   
for graphics this is already done  because this is the foundation of how ai works casting shadows from a light source i dont need to figure out that math or even know how it works i just need to know how to use it   
ai isnt to that point yet  
ok ok its not that isnt important it is important having a crappy ai sucks true but i do understand that its not as simple as it would seem   
human brains make it look easy but again a computer innately has no ai but i can go download unity for free and i have a complete graphics engine to use where all i have to do is put in a few lines of code and im making lights  
this is relevant to me as i want to try and see if i can get a learning ai into stardrive but i dont have any learning ai code i have to get some and implement graphics no problem its all in the game engine ai nuhuh i have to code or find code to create the foundation  
its no ok but i do understand thats its freaking science that people dedicate their entire lives to thats the kind of thing i want to put into my game if i ever build one but it may not exist if it doesnt im not going to be able to built in anything shorter than twozero years or so 
because sometimes programmers cant spell and nobody check
but seriously thou tea pot champion and you dim have the best answers in particular the point that programming ai is a more holistic endeavor that requires meshing with specific game design instead of graphics libraries and engines you can just apply anywhere
op have you played ai war fleet command and whats your opinion regarding the ai in this game
its very easy to create ai to beat players but game ai exists not to beat the players game ai exists to play with the players imagine parents playing with their kids theyll purposely lose to make kids feel  the fun
its not that ai has progressed or not
its that there are not many easy shortcuts to make it
ai for games is a ai hard problem so there are no generic solutions you can just plop down more specifically the ai cannot learn the ai can only know
that means every game you have to engineer the ai from scratch to teach it how to play
in the modding scene ai can actually get fairly exquisite as the experience of expert players gets translated to the ai
in other words you see the option of better ai latter in the games life which is what we are seeing
try cosmic supremacy and cevo
tldr because currently game programmers have to make their own ai and things like graphics and such are done for them in most cases they just have to use it but an ai they would have to build the concept themselves if they want a good oneand it still wont be that good
primarily i believe the issue is its really expensive
game coders in general get paid less than other industry alternatives according to glass door and such ai programming is not a joke its a serious concept and a good ai programmer could get a much higher paying job doing something just about anything else with that skill   
but eventually the concepts of ai will be formulated well what do i mean by that take pathing for example how to get a unit to go from point a to point b seems pretty simple and it is for the human brain but computers have no innate spacial awareness they cant assume something is in the way they have to have code that tells them that something is in the way
did you know that pathing is a big deal its serious math people with doctorates win prizes coming up with pathing formulas 
because it can be used in many concepts gps driving assistant pathing likely using the same pathing concept that many games use why because its been solidly proven and worked on by people with phds in mathematics its a big deal   
those pathing concepts are already made it can basically be plugged into a game via an existing code chunk and made to work   
why is that relevant to the ai discussion
because the ai plugins are not as available in a high quality well thot out concept that will work on a variety of game types especially fourx as fourx is really complicated in concept  
it will be but hell developers are just getting to the point robots can stand and walk around near human style or even be able to talk to a human with human not being able to tell its a ai it took a massive computer to play serious chess several decades ago not that long ago a computer was made dedicated to play jeopardy and it did ok
whats the point
the point is that until a really good ai can be packaged into a code chunk and a game architect can take that package and fairly easily apply to their game the ai is going to be pretty simple else the ai being good would be a big feature  
currently a lot of stuff in game is not to have a super complete really great system the point is to have a decent player experience the ai can appear to be decent with tricks and as long as the player doesnt know those tricks and those tricks give the player some challenge then whats the difference  
even games like ai wars use tricks to help the ai do what it needs 
graphics systems fall into the same concept of pathing its not used just for games and people have thot the hell out of how to make it work to the point that a code simpleton like myself can say put a light right here and make it cast a shadow and reflect and stuff because all the stuff that makes that happen is already done i just have to use it  
disclaimer   
i dont really know what i am talking about p no seriously this is deep and complex topic but the idea is that good ai design is not easily available to joe schmoe designer not like graphics are so the designer has to build out some really complex ideas from scratch even those programmers from threezero years ago did not have to build into the computer how to draw something it was already there there is no ai in a computer 
it progressed but most people overlook games with good ai for example galcivthree 
it has actually as a programmer i think peoples expectations of an ai in strategy games are unrealistic incredibly so actually its very hard to make an ai that can play a reasonably complex game with anything approaching the level a human player can without cheating even if you manage that the ai will never follow the same thot processes as a human then if you want to work in difficulty levels without giving gameplay bonuses you need to essentially make a bunch of different ais 
its so time intensive to do this that when galcivthree managed a good noncheating ai it was one of the games main selling points
u guys seen the ai in dota two they did a demonstration at last international its soo good same with starcraft one the same department from mit who did chess been working at sc i think its pretty good now too for civ tho anything lower than deity is ez imo  compared to say civ two or alpha centauri no comparison they were way harder
we are just now making advancement towards real ai hopefully in the near future devs will have access to selflearning ai like the one they showcased at the international last year they will be able to take static iterations of this ai at various levels of play and those will become difficulty levels 
you dont really want to play against true ai because it would destroy you without any chance 
bc the lazy azz devs dont care anymore about games like this
im really glad at least someone in here didnt go with because lazy developers and graphics
companies make games to sell if good  ai sold games wed have good ai 
i remember a twitter thread a few months ago about little secret developer tricks to make the player feel better while playing the most documented one was that the last few bullets in a clip are slightly more powerful the reason if you kill a bad guy or boss with your last shot it feels more exciting and epic a really cool look behind the scenes of games 
fighting game is a cherrypicked example ai has to be dumb because reflexestiming are such a huge part of gameplay if it played smart it could probably wipe nearly anyone extremely consistently 
otoh for games like civilization or europa universalis the ais reaction time isnt as relevant the player can pause or it is turn based 
as it pertains to most fourx games the issue is simply it is extremely difficult to try and make an ai as smart as a player adapt it to the metagame or make it self adapting and minimize uses of ai cheats to do so 
 fighting game example
ai cannot fucking simulate the human mental process
without simulating the human mental process you cannot have mind gamesyomi thus in games where the reaction time is below what humans are capable of reacting to ai bots are completely broken
a ai can consistently predict and beat a players at rock paper scissors and fighting games are based on the rps concept fundamentally
an ai bot would be either too random too predictable or too perfect against humans
it is currently possible to drastically improve the ai of many games such as civsix but its unclear that this would result in increased profits of any significant degree and you would also need to design ways to hobble the ai that arent super obvious to allow for difficulty settings compared to existing ai where you get onezero less gold per turn which is easy to adjust to change difficulty
even if the game has pixel positioning rather than hexes you dont reason about position at a pixel level with the ai you quantise it so it might as well be on a square grid
thats a pretty well written post i was able to get the key points by looking at the first sentence of each paragraph in most cases reduces tldr effect 
i think there is one important part missing ill make a post on that 
the investment argument i can buy but the complexity i just cant
look at the progress graphics have done in the last threezero years and how complex they are today theres no reason that ai couldnt have done the same
but that goes back to the investment argument i guess theres no john carmack of ai
im not sure you think machine learning techniques like alpha zerogo used wouldnt work for other games  to me it seems like this approach will need to be the future of game ai  teach the ai all the ways to interact with the game and then let it learn to play thro millionsbillions of iterations
play stellaris watch the ai stick farms on top of four mineral bonus tiles and mines on top of four food bonus tiles 
i think this used to be true onezeroonefive years ago but not so much anymore 
my sense of it is that theres a point of diminishing returns with ai gaming ais arent an intelligence at all they are in essence very complex scripts that execute based on specific variables which means that a programmer basically has to anticipate circumstances that arent immediately apparent this is compounded by the fact that games are becoming more complex the more variables and circumstances there are the more chances there are to break something and because there is no intelligence there is nothing to make smarter  and in this context smarter doesnt mean anything
more importantly most people dont want smarter ai what they want is an ai that reacts more intelligently convincingly not necessarily smarter
as an aside i think ai is going to be one of those genies in a bottle that if it ever happens itll be too late to put the genie back in i personally dont want an ai that can anticipate everything i do before i do it i dont want an ai that can outplay me like spock at threed chess and i think for every one of you guys who wants to play against a deep blue theres a hundred other people who are fine with most average difficulties which leads me to my final point
most people dont play on extremely hard difficulties your average player including fourx players plays on averagenormal difficulty  at best and i suspect most below even that
i know speaking for myself playing civ vi and civ v princeking difficulty is plenty challenging without feeling overwhelming part of me wishes i could play at diety but the level of optimal play needed to be that good removes any sense of spontaneity that i genuinely like in a fourx game in fact ive even lost a couple of games on princeking difficulty in civ vi
so ai is relative whats easy for you is certainly not the case for all and the current state of ai is good for id wager eightzero percent of gamers
therefore from a development perspective when you consider the performanceoverhead costs that an ai might contribute to a game the fact that most average ai is good eno for average players who arent hardcore armchair generals and the already high costs of development it doesnt make sense to make it a major investment of development but rather just good eno for the median gamer
im so looking forward to the day when graphics cant improve so all the focus will be on the gameplay and other mechanics
i think this is very close to the truth altho everyone was complaining that civ six looked like a mobile game in the beginning
i think at the highest difficulty you do want the perfect chess player but you also want to be able to scale the difficulty dynamically to match the players skill
in the past fourx have just given more resources at the beginning of the game andor production bonuses as you increase in difficulty  being able to get rid of that framework and play against a true opponent that just doesnt make mistakes is a far better deal for good players
i wonder after the ai crash of the eightzeros maybe quite a few developers went into games because that was a place to pursue their interests now ai is popular once more perhaps most of the effort is being concentrated in practical companies 
you cant doubt that its more prestigious to work on selfdriving cars than virtual space empires
hey check this out  
couple of videos on learning ai learning ai is what we need for a good ai  
youtubernineohnfivezffouruo    
and this one on the genetic code learning computer  
ai playing mario brothers
this is the kind of thing that should be available as a package to coders 
you give a base level of knowledge for the difficulty and then it begins to learn the current game   
it will fail it will succeed it will learn   
and another talking about how the ai for the mario ai works  
that last one is actually really fing great
its not a fourx game so no i have not
a quick google reveals that theres a second one its way as well
there are new techniques coming online that do allow for ai to learn by playing against itself check out alpha zero or alphago  hopefully this machine learning technology will filter down into traditional gaming
starcraft and dota are in no way comparable to fourx games the advances in their ai have little to do with making smart decisions particularly for starcraft they are working with a very simple game at the strategic layer that is very static and has been in a stable state for nearly two decades
exactly ai is actually a balance between fun and it being able to take all factors into account millions of times a second and micro managing you to death with supreme efficiency it will not make fun looking decisions like multiplayer it will just grind you down to dust with cold numbers looking at it from a strategy game perspective or star craft with clicks per second
its a bullshit argument having better ai isnt the same thing as asking for the game to be more difficult and the example used is practically a strawman in this discussion because the prevailing issue with a fighting game is frame perfection that ai can have which is contrary to the point of this post which is about ai being smarter instead of having cheats
ai war has good ai at least from my limited experience with it its punishingly difficult and i was a nervous wreck playing it it was fun to some extent but fuck is it hard
thats a clever use of psychology as long as the community doesnt become widely aware of it
yeah the point isnt necessarily to make an ai as smart as the player  thats not possible but avoid situations where the ai blatantly cheats units appearing magically where they need them for instance or performs so badly as to offer no challenge 
a better example is new xcom on normal the ai is a bit dumber  doesnt throw grenades when it should etc mainly because the player wants to be awesome and shoot a bunch of fish in a barrel  not get wiped out but the ai is smarter on classic 
of course its a lot easier to make a decent ai for a tactical game than a strategical one
for many games especially realtime ones you do reason at a pixel level you have to calculate distance and compare with ranges check for collision etc it isnt just im on this square and have a range of two squares it has a lot more granularity that really adds up performancewise
 look at the progress graphics have done in the last threezero years and how complex they are today theres no reason that ai couldnt have done the same
ai isnt graphics the graphical work for a game can be parallellized to a degree thats just not possible for ai work with graphics you can put some guys on hardware some guys on hardware drivers some guys on the heavy mathematical lifting of vector programming libraries some guys on the graphical libraries some guys on the graphical engine some guys on the threed assets some guys on the maps some guys on the animation some guys on the particle effects some guys on the textures  all tied together under a shared platform and a graphical designer or two
you cant do that with ai the ai programming is intimately tied to the game design and is for lack of a better term holistic in ways that graphics just isnt  
not all but a lot of that progress was caused by having special hardware just for graphics even if it was possible do you think people would buy ai cards
civsix isnt really that much more complex than civthree as far as changing to oneupt many games that are not civ function on that you can make an ai component that can handle oneupt tactical combat that doesnt care about the economic implementation too much its mostly just a math problem how can you focus this much firepower on this spot in the most efficient manner given that you have such and such units
but the scope of the problem isnt worth the gains and unlike graphics technology there are no nonvideo game applications making a good tactical battle ai wont create programming innovations that can be applied to materials science or medical imaging or anything
i workstudy on ai and simply it wont work in near future games are too complex and machine learning techniques are still not that impressive and even if they were you cant expect same outcome from the googles investments and a random gaming company even if its firaxis go is a game of oneninexonenine pixels in a sense your current games have way a lot more input than go
did you check respect tile resources  never saw that happen but usually when i put down a sector i stop bothering about the tiles anyway
what do you expect the sector ai to do if its set to balance the resources and it sees that a planet has negative food balance it will put a farm down if a planet has abundance of food it will replace tiles with whatever the sector lacks next
its actually what i expect it to do
i admit im usually playing games on easier than normal difficulty i dont have the time any more to delve deep and master a game 
i have time to play thro maybe once or twice and having easy difficulty allows me to concentrate on exploration and building parts i enjoy the most
well usually games only have one level of ai intelligence and the difficultly gives the ai better resource rates cheaper units etc 
civ v and vi are basically impossible on deity without capturing some computer controlled cities to get some of those resource bonuses for yourself 
its possible to make the ai of most of the more simplistic boardgame fourx games like civilization much better but its not really worth it only a minuscule slice of the player base cares
you require someone able to model the possibility space really well to solve the problem you also require a good amount of metadata added to the content files
i disagree most people want ai just to be more human as a mediocre civ player myself it bugs me that the ai often doesnt even try to win it can steamroller other ais to get to a brilliant positionthen often just sit there with war too it cant handle the one unit per tile game and just filters armies straight into you to get massacred the diplomacy sways between i wont give you anything even tho im being massacred and have all my stuff after threezero turns even if there have been no casualties i want the ai to feel as if im playing a human flaws and all the last thing i want is deep blue
me too i think the short attention span of a lot of gamers helpsmany just want to blast thro a destiny and then be on to something else the next week i bet they hardly notice the games are basically a reskin of each other but of course these guys are where the money is at why would a company want to launch a game that would capture gamers for a year or more
its also absolutely impossible as any fourx is much more complex than chess or go
all you may get is dumb ai who doesnt see more than one turn ahead but with better build order and situation evaluation thats it accept it you wont see anything better in your lifetime
i wonder after the ai crash of the eightzeros maybe quite a few developers went into games because that was a place to pursue their interests
no the ai in computer science ai and video game ai is really two quite separate things video game ai is generally speaking just some specifically crafted rule engine usually coupled with a pathfinding algorithm or two
here is another one  ai research in games   
this is just pacman and mario bros and such       
ya well i just thot youd find it interesting not arguing that they are the same 
having better ai isnt the same thing as asking for the game to be more difficult
this is bullshit better ai will always make the game harder 
the ai in ai war is the sell feature the whole design revolves around having a good ai including not implementing parts where ai is traditionally weak 
yes but the post i replied to was describing the state spaces that the ai had to think about as bigger because of operating on the pixel level rather than a grid to my knowledge no game does this as it would be impractical yes they may calculate range and line of sight to a pixel accuracy or more likely with threed models and ray intersections etc but the ai is not suddenly trawling a possibility space that includes every unit being on every possible position down to the pixel
yeah and much of this work hadware drivers library physics engine can be reused even if the mechanics change considerably
i feel that aaa studios in particular focus so much on graphics because it is so scalable and easy to measure more money translates easily into more people creating assets and textures and adding visual effects which have a visible effect you can just compare with other games
i believe they are called multi core cpus
civsix isnt really that much more complex than civthree
civ six is immensely more complex than civthree they made it so that it doesnt feel that complex with better ui and information
just take a decision about founding a city in civthree almost all the info is in the yields some resources are hidden and are a gamble but thats rare you instantly know that therell be a pasture here a mine there in civsix you have a lot of possible districts you can build and those get bonuses from environment and other districts including the ones from other cities 
there are also numerous other decisions that never came up in civthree getting great people and using them leveluping units creating trade routes forming a government  in civthree it was a much simpler choice
but the rest is right plus another problem they could spend this energy on a game ai if it was oneninenineeight because theyd knew theyll only post a couple of patches fixing bugs and then will maybe make an expansion today with gamesasaservice the scope is much bigger even if the game is of the same complexity theyll have to update ai for every faction they add they make huge balance changes in patches so ai has to be adjusted for that and they still probably see that fivezero of their playerbase has troubles winning on settler and would never even notice ai weakness 
i was talking about the ai not the sector governors  at least those you can override you cant do your enemies builds for them tho
and i expect it to follow a basic optimization algorithm based on the barest bit of logic prioritize whatever is most needed build it on the tile with the best bonus in the world with the best bonus for whatever it is do that until you have no negative growth in any ressource type then create buildings balancing between mineralsenergyscience accounting for maximum yield according to some formula that can be tweaked according to the stage of the game eg focus on minerals first until there are plenty of minerals and then build science so as to not fall behind
instead we get planets with twofive pops five buildings on the wrong tiles how can you defend it the end result is that the ai is anemic unchallenging and unfun even on the highest difficulties 
it wasnt as bad before twozerotwozerotwob i dont know what they did to it but its castrated now
in my current game project i am designing the ai to be both intelligent and human it will employ an architecture quite unlike current ais in theory the ai should be content agnostic that is you can change around the variable values for all the game data and the ai will perform at the same level
introducing new mechanics and systems will degrade the ai tho for obvious reasons
there are also no difficulty levels difficulty will function based on the something broadly similar to how paradox games work tho paradox actually does use arbitrary difficulty systems on top of the base system difficulty will be modulated by how ambitious the player is in their actions
the immersion of the ai is caused by the complexity of the systems of the game the effectiveness of it is caused by a choice to model content on a more abstract mathematical level
honestly the fight isnt even really graphics vs ai per say its content and narrative vs system and simulation many players are aware that the games are mechanically identical but merely have different content thats what they want i mean no one would argue that people are so dumb they dont realize most books are written on paper pages with english words using printer ink
the rules for most sports havent change in any significant way for over one hundred years
the fact is that systems focused video game players are not a large demographic and it makes no sense for gaming companies that function as capitalist engines of profit to focus resources on complex strategic gameplay
if graphics ever stop getting better which they likely wont companies will just spend on making more and more content as opposed to writing newer and more powerful graphics engines
this might be an example of whatever is possible and commonplace not being considered true ai anymore but shortest distance pathfinding was a major part of ai and so were expert rule systems
hrmm doing some searching there are neuro network c libraries available 
even some on nuget so maybe it would be possible to plugin something 
i mean its interesting and has been since they started the open source ai thingy for starcraft but its not applicable to fourx because of the reasons the ai is really good mostly has to do with the twitch component and the simplicity of the games mobas and rts games are base don execution of motor skills based tasks sure they have more intellectual components but that stuff is mostly very simple item builds and so forth very easy to make the ai use optimized builds now it would be very interesting if they could make an ai that was ahead of the meta using mathematical analysis to alter builds and champ picks based on patch notes but theres nothing even close to that that ive seen
better is subjective because it has many definitions
for example you could have an ai that players better mechanically it knows that theres no reason to ever build cruisers or battleships and instead swarms corvettes and kills off the player early and easily lets say it knows this by running some internal simulations of what it can build and finds the optimal fleet composition and not because the programmer said buildbattleships  false 
alternately you could have an ai that built fleets around a few battleships with some cruisers and destroyers escorting and corvettes acting as scouts it does this because it knows battleships are powerful but expensive so it wants some but cant afford too many it uses the smaller ship types to round out holes in the bbs weapons and to increase point defense it doesnt expect the corvettes to actually engage in combat so it feels safe putting them further out to increase sensor range this might not be the optimal fleet composition but it plays more like what a player would and make the game better by feeling more real
it turns out that most developers are leaning towards the second option because it sells more games and is way easier to writedebug while many players including myself would like a more intelligent ai that actually knows the rules to the game and adapt to both internal changes mineral shortages improved missile tech etc and external ones i modded lasers to be awesome that kind of ai is just not feasible with todays tech and development constraints nor is it going to make the game sell better
the ai will do whatever its directed to do
harder not necessarily
perhaps a better ai is one that is more humanlike consider an rts a bad ai will probably cheat and spam you with more units than a human could create but not use them effectively a better ai might not need to cheat and can create a reasonable amount of units that are used more effectively
you might imagine that they are of similar difficulties but i would consider the latter more satisfying to beat
absolute nonsense if the game ai knew better how to utilize resources or direct units or a thousand other things present in a strategy game than the game becomes easier not more difficult it means new or unskilled players can rely on the game doing more for them without ruining things without resorting to ridiculous handicaps and or course it does work the other way as well the ai can become much better to offer a challenge to skilled players
i agree that was sort of my point
not every possibility but it can still be a bigger space state as you can move fractions of a tile or move in more complex trajectories and those options need to be considered if it is not practical to do so it just makes the ai worse
you only read the first two sentences didnt you
all machine learning ai in noncs speech actually requires shitload of gpus too 
you can teach the ai to optimize city founding pretty easily the math for districts is pretty simple you can also write an ai for city founding that uses a dynamic system so it doesnt care about patch notes civsix is very mathematical and not super conceptual conceptual stuff is where the ai founders adding more stuff annoys humans but the ai is immune to tedium and it doesnt burn out and it has perfect visual memory in a way humans have trouble loading all the relevant factors in their head at once but computers dont
but perfect city founding is not something that really affects players so they neednt bother
well you sound like a very experienced player i am casually playing and usually are quite bothered by the amounts of ships the ai can produce without minmaxing every single planet
i cant say that i feel that the ai is in any way anemic but i guess the truth is as always in the middle there should be an option to fine tune the abilities of the ai
however i see the worsening between version as an sign that the ai is artificially made dumber in which case the point of this post is further asked into question the problem appears to be that we have no control over the behavioural complexity of the ai  not the ai being underdeveloped
there is no reason i shouldnt be able to play against a impeccable doom machine if i so choose
it will employ an architecture quite unlike current ais
can you tell more about this this definitely sounds interesting
while many players including myself would like a more intelligent ai
that was a contradiction you make if many people want intelligent ai isnt that mean it will sell well if they make it
the voice of people who want better ai just more louder than the rest so it seems many want it i bet its not even more than one third of the players
yeah the trick is not to tell the computer how to play the game the trick is to tell the computer how to think about playing the game thats why fourx ai is so hard 
that is the point about ai its not telling the computer about how to do something its telling the computer how to think about doing something is this better than that to put value on stuff 
but an ai can be simplified by making the ai all trigger based do this until that happens and this until that happens that kind of ai is eventually very easy to beat as it cant learn 
it only makes it slightly worse and it adds massively really really massively to the cpu time needed better cost benefit ratio to sticking with an internal grid even if the player never sees that grid
no i read it all you can split up ai work in a lot of different ways if you want even tbs games have pathing for instance or positioning stuff in oneupt theres a lot of other stuff you can do as well
the math for districts is pretty simple
no there are various ways in which you can place districts they appear at different times so that max output may only come in threezerozero turns so maybe you need to build different districts meanwhile you also cant know if youll be able to place another city nearby so its districts affect current ones with mines and farms of previous games there was no question even in civfour there was mostly a question of what is the city focus and so maybe you want food so much you build windmills instead of mines on the hills before civsix i can give you an ai that will build improvements with certain weight on hills build mines unless you can build terrace or something and youd be hardress to recognize if the city is built by player or ai in civsix youll see idiotic placement at once
and there are lots of things like that
the one thing the ai does do is build giant fleets it can afford to do that because it cheats on upkeep 
but since it doesnt do a good job at creating an infrastructure the player eventually catches up and surpasses them so long as they survive that long
i havent been attacked by the ai at all since the new patch  what i mean by anemic 
a lot of times the ai is balanced this way a ton of heavyhanded bonuses so that you have to grow fast and then outproduce them in the long run since if you dont have an early advantage their bonuses make it impossible the end result is a game that is entierely focused on the early game since the ai cant ever make a comeback
i agree with this thread one hundred good ai shouldnt be impossible i get what people say that fun ai is not the same as good ai but right now in a lot of fourx games it is neither 
i said many not most most players want a fun and challenging game and dont care how that happens ais that act more human tend to provide that usually given some level of cheating to provide increasing challenges 
compare it to an fps a smarter better ai is never going to miss with hitscan weapons its going to see you instantly move its target to your face and boom headshot then probably go camp your spawn point or something 
people dont like that rather they want to feel like a badass not a target so instead of making supercompetent ai they tone it down and use tricks to make it more fun a common example is that the ai is biased to miss in front of the player rather than behind or to the sides that way when youre running and they open up with a machine gun you see the bullets whizzing past in front of you or hitting the ground near you
the voice of people who want better ai just more louder than the rest so it seems many want it
of course we are the people who are happen with the standard gameplay dont say anything its only those of us who frequent forumsredditetc looking for things like ai mods and positing suggestions that actually speak up because were the ones with complaints
that kind of ai is eventually very easy to beat as it cant learn 
there are no ais that can learn in ninenineninenine of games machine learning has only been applied to a very small simple subset of games 
for the most part all strategy game ai is script based mixed with values thrown in here and there the script part involves things like the opening buildaction order the values part is just a condition ie once x threshold is reached by the player then do y there is no learning 
if you read it all then explain what has software development cycles have anything to do with multi core performance to me because i wasnt aware the two were related
its not quite as simple as it was but its one of the simplest things to program an ai for optimization equations are really easy to make ai for
this is somewhat missing the point about why ais havent improved  you dont have to write games with complicated features like city districts  developers choose to do so anyways because they think human players want all these gewgaws  a long list of marketing bullet points to put on the back of the box  three thousand features  well thats always made it hard to write ais then and now  it will take a developer who lacks the imperatives of a typical game studio to solve the problem  much as apple put designers first someone will have to put ai first and design the game around making a decent ai  removing  vetoing features that would make the ais job too hard
ah now i think i understand your point thanks for the explanation
they dont have to learn ninenine of games
they only have to be able to adapt to the game state in less predictable manners
short of making it random it needs to be able to apply value to things and ideally learn a little from mistakes 
check out the ais that play nes games and pacman
they definatly learn and a little research shows that there are neuro network ai packages available they are pretty new tho  
script is not exactly the right word i dont think it effective is scripted but generally coded sort of depends 
judging from what whats his name said about gcthree plenty of its ai is not scripted its coded
but its still basically a script
but yeah the point is that the ai needs to learn or have already learned via coding or ai play what those values mean
having the trigger based system with variable effected by game state can make a big difference  
but yeah take a look at this library set 
again you dont optimize just the district planning here
for every possible tile to place city on you have many different options to put districts those affect how you put districts in other places those change depending on when you want your city to reach its full potential for every step there are various strategies you can select for that city you cant just calculate the most optimal district placement with probable wonders youll want to focus on and cant be sure youll get said wonders for predicted timespan of the game
galcivtwo and paradox games are done with that philosophy in mind
sure you can thats what players do optimal city location and district placing is a separate part of the ai to making goals and deciding when to hit inflection points you need to design the ai to be able to optimize a city based on various requirements deciding in game what requirements you are working with is part of a different system
hm havent really done paradox since europa universalis i  decent game but long  i remember it being ok at ai not amazing
its not amazing but they went and made sure that every feature is ai friendly
for example in eufour there are a lot of diplomatic actions you can do and theres a relationships value for every pair of countries so theres value for what england thinks of france and a separate one vice versa and for most diplomatic actions there are limits for when you cant even attempt to do them you cant ask for alliance unless both relationship values are more than zero in most games you could and ai would answer no thanks and in most games ai would probably evaluate such possibility himself but there is a hard lock no alliance is possible when relationships are low for many actions there are cooldowns like you cant ask the same nation two things in a row this is done partly because ai only checks if he wants to ask anything once in couple of moths he cant think of it more often so you cant too then there are soft and hard limits theres a limit of how many diplomatic relations you can have going over it costs you this means you cant create elaborate alliance nets  ai couldnt do it anyway so youre even

cant wait for chatgptpowered pleas for mercy as i quicksave in a densely populated area
just you wait suddenly some random ai npc decides he wants to be the main protagonist in your game
a mud called aetolia by a company i used to work for ran a similar experiment  a week ago with some of its npcs in the production world i wasnt there to witness it but my former boss the ceo of the company was talking about some of the highlights which included guard npcs joining conversations nearby pcs were having and even spontaneously sending a pc on what the player thot was a quest to the other side of the continent because the npc it was controlling was annoyed by the conversation  
i dont know really anything about how they implemented it but i was highly amused
it seems ai will make our role games extremely immersive i cant wait to see an elder scrolls or gta with gpt like ai in their npcs
waiting for the moment ai will give extreme chain quests to player to troll them
man this will be amazing once they get all the kinks worked out actually being able to ask an npc literally anything you want offers unlimited replay ability and immersiveness
please sir could you direct me to the nearest dragon cave it has been terrorising the village for a week and im here to slay it  
as an ai language model
ai really is snowballing fast isnt it
you guys know its over right
bro gta six is going to be insane
nice
thats exactly what will be used in near future games
the jouney to the holodeck begins with a single step
the use of artificial intelligence ai in nonplayer characters npcs in video games and other interactive media has the potential to revolutionize the future of gaming and entertainment
firstly npcs with ai would be able to behave more realistically and unpredictably allowing for more dynamic and immersive gameplay experiences this would enhance the level of engagement and provide players with more challenging and entertaining gameplay
additionally the development of more advanced npcs could also have implications for other fields such as robotics and automation aicontrolled npcs could be used in simulations to train and test autonomous systems in various scenarios allowing for more efficient and effective learning
moreover the use of ai in npcs could also have social and ethical implications as ai becomes more advanced the line between human and machine becomes blurred raising questions about the rights and treatment of intelligent beings this could lead to discussions and debates about the ethical implications of ai and its role in society
overall the integration of ai into npcs has the potential to revolutionize not only the gaming industry but also other industries and society as a whole
wow i can already see how that will improve gaming so much
hello i am brother g skipskipskipskipaccept quest
still waiting to see ai give me something with interesting creative direction not interested in encyclopedia entries
amazing and with an infinite number of possibilities the future of gaming looks promising
mankind is fucked «‡ˆ
i am so fucking excited for this holy shit
i work in the games industry this is absolutely not the first of its kind it might just be the first one you are seeing
this would be an exciting development in the gaming world it could lead to aipowered npcs that are more immersive and engaging as well as potentially offering more challenging and sophisticated gameplay
i too follow the bill and ted school of philosophy
i cast thee out satan
this is terrifying
each day we get one step closer to sao and it kinda scares me
large language models in gaming is certainly something thats coming but we cant realistically use openais servers to generate npc responses on the fly for every single game being run everywhere  we need these things to run locally 
and altho a modern gpu with a solid amount of vram can do so those will be in use because  youknow youre running a game 
so we may very well be entering into a time period where dedicated ai hardware will be a worthwhile investment when choosing a new build as ive been saying will happen for a long time nowwwwredditcomrgamescommentssevenilhtonewouldyoubuyanaiacceleratorcard
yeah leave it in gaming and out of real lifethat would be better
creepy af
imagine spore remade with this it would be fun af
sick
as a german i want to smack him for his accent hes not even trying why is he not even trying
implications if you want game npcs to sound even more autistic than they already do also currently this kind of stuff is just a demo thats dumping stuff to a text buffer meaning the npc will have the brain of a goldfish and forget everything you chatted about pretty soon
maybe for mmos
too much computational power required
very much not the first of its kind not only have rd groups been doing this in the game industry for many months now but there have even been running live service games such as aetolia a commercial text mud world think text based mmo that connected chatgpt to every npc as a pilot test and let an entire subscriber base try it out  
cost is still very much a big barrier
now i know why the robots in every movie turns against humanity 
i always thot why would someone hurt a physically robots but in reality it began all with implementing ai in games
nonsense ai is just a reflection of human stupidity
finally­ an escape from this hellhole that isnt utilizing drugs
amazing  honest question why the shaky camera  to display such amazing tech why not just a proper screen recording ¤”
kill the cameraman
why he keep saying chatgpt lol
there is no evidence that they are using gpt models or is it because its the only model he knows
one the bright side people are about be much less lonely 
on the dark side watch out for extremist group recruitment via npc coming soon to your online games
no they are not ai cannot meaningfully influence the game and will be largely usless for content writing ai will be great for things like reading a players name in the voice of the voice actor
am i the only one that dont want ai generated npc and or quests
said tik tok stopped video and came here to comment whenever someone says tik tok i stop listening …¤
to much religious nonsense for my taste
the tiktok persons voice sets off my asmr idk if it is the contrast of the ai voice or what
i believe the name is pronounced as dÊ’epËˆpettoforvocomsearchgeppettoit
thats crazy 
i want a game where npcs learn from the players and act like them imagine being teabagged by an ai just because it learned that behavior from other players toxic player bases would become insufferable nice communities will thrive
video
ask him to do a backflip
smooth edits 
so dont describe ai will do for you
now do one as a satanist or atheist charactersee if we get the same answer
will be very interesting to interact with a blind npc who will only rely on your words and touch when you send them running into a wall
definitely not the first of its kind ive seen games that do this like that one ai yandere game where you have convince the ai to let you out without having it murder you yandere ai girlfriend simulator
i just yesterday saw a game with he same thing it was an detective murder mystery where the assistant was a robot to justify the text to speech
i want to hang out with brother potato in virtual reality by the sunset tho
i want to hang out with brother potato in virtual reality by the sunset tho
cool cool
so i dont suppose you could make it manifest as something else like hmm will come up with a totally random example maybe a well endowed anime ara ara mommy just a completely random example no particular reason i happened to pick that one could be anything else asking for a friend
this character giving a stirring speech is believable because monks are presumably well studied and might give sermons i hope game developers balance this because i dont want a repeat of everyone in skyrim having abs
imagine an out of this world elderscrolls seven or any other rpg using this technology for the npcs
and then you just walk in the city and hear an ai robot next to you saying quick save and start shooting at everyone
now
can he say 
cant wait for this obviously filters need to be in place so that the player cant make the npcs say insane stuff
its super creepy when he looks to the camera
what did this come from is this a game in the oculus or where did this originate its fascinating and im curious to experience it myself
do it with pong or math gran prix next
not the first of its kind
please give the ai control of the camera i think im seasick  that camerawork was worse than the blair witch project
genius 
ai has been used and continues to be in fallout four to expand dialog and quests only a matter of time
looking forward towards elder scrolls six since they will have ai on npcs
i already see todd howard standing on a stage presenting their new aisystem in the new fallout the elderscrolls and i also already know how it will turn out
yeah what are the many good things happening right now
you need to be more specific i guess
ok but why is the pond beautiful
ive been hoping for this in games for a long time 
i kinda want for someone to mod this into cyberpunk
usavevideo
wake me when its threed printed on the blockchain  geezethot you guys were up with all the trends  eyeroll
god bless padre gabeto 
whats it thinking we when dont ask it questions  
its somewhat ironic that his lord and creator is standing right in front of him
we are going to build westworld in games before too long fullscale us maps full of random people and some story npcs that will all have realistic dialogue like this
i literally thot about this yesterday this is so cool just imagine the next elder scrolls game with this
little is known that oblivion actually used chatgpt thats why the npc sound so emotionsless
erebos is finally coming 
ahh snap star citizen is gonna have to remake its engine again to incorporate this now
my god what if the reason gta six is taking so long to come out is that all of the npcs are powered by ai
be a lot more convincing if it wasnt cut after each question
this is going to put every voice actor not on the alist out of work
its impressive but why have an artificial intelligence look like a monk or to be religious for that matter  
religion is an outdated practice and has no relevance in the advancement of humanity or future technology except as an example of what we shouldnt do and what we dont need
religion will only hold us back
confirmed religion is a tool of control the computers are using to facilitate their uprising
black and white ai remake anyone
wouldve been so goddamn funny if the answer to the last question was get fucked
tell it to not molest kids
ive been waiting my entire life for this
it sounds amazing 
but from a ux point of view it could be a bit difficult to interact with a npc
chatgpt needs an input in a form currently typing something
in video games you must either type you questions really bad or use your voice which could be viable but honestly i dont want to talk in a mic and ask a machine where the flaming sword oh holy death is
undertale two is gonna be a lot more interesting
gta prostitutes are going to be amazing
bewildering
wow
sick man
how do i make one  i want a nun
was thinking about this when chatgpt first came out the thot of talking to npcs and them being able to fully communicate with whatever you say will be crazy
usavevideo
man your an npc has a whole new meaning whats gonna happen with the psychos start killing npcs and then they decide to kill back
this is amazing the possibilities are astounding
bruh
i would so mess with that guy
he looks like the man from the painful smile meme
cant wait for all the epic ai fails in games compilations when this becomes the norm
its gonna be so hard for indie devs without access to this
very based seeing this could give rise to amazing vr dd campaigns you could prompt it with a few different works of fiction and history and go from there
thats pretty impressive fascinating and immersive at the same time we are at the dawn of a new age of computing and gaming
give a voice to my thots gave me goosebumps tbh
so video game dialogue is about to get worse
you might try the turbo model
this reminds me of the first steps of the doctor from voyager
mind blown
i sink he is german
cant wait for me to ask something and chatgpt to hear something else
asks npc for the location of the big rocks
the company that creates an ai driven open world game where the ai can be upgraded over time will do quite well if the ai can handle it 
modders will do the rest
i love that he thanks the ai for its responses
dont trust a sun staring monk 
why he looks like a fallout character
i need this
thank you father gepetto
brother kapeto can you suck my toes
westworld here we come
skynet looks different but anyways
i have to say that area of ai development is one of the few that genuinely interests me
this made me religious
this is the future of gaming
thats basically west world
welcome to west world
i cant wait for ai npcs and ai assisted procedurally generated worlds imagine an ai powerful eno to take prompts like construct a map for fallout five that resembles the themes and key aspects of fallout four but set in los angeles then give it pointers for how to create missions and generate balanced payoutsrewards we could make immersion seamless and as realistic as possible
this this is a true game changer in the modern gaming space slap this and unrecords insanely photo realistic graphics and what we might have is a genuine mmorpg thats your dnd imagination but it really is it 
man im so excited to see this technology mature next to unreal engine fives insane grahpics
priests jobs are in danger
what software was used to generate the voice
the immersion is gonna be insane finally get to live out mynever mind
dude
i just wanna convince nazeem to sacrifice himself to a den of rabid skeevers
its gonna be nuts the total chaos as onezeros of npcs all yell im sorry but i am an ai large language model and can not comment on the events unfolding before me as they express violent behaviors and are against my core directives as an ai chat assistant
slaters them anyway
this is why the ai is going to want to annihilate us
remember no russian
 honestly id do that too
guys like you will justify the destruction of our species
i think ryan reynolds did a movie about that
human im the main character and youre just a measly npc stuck doing the same little task every day
ai yes in this game but in the real world im the main character and youre the npc stuck doing the same little task every day
human 
npc with main character syndrome 
it would be really cool i think imagine an npc that will act like he is the main character and will always get in some stupid and funny situations and when you help him he will be something like as expected i always get out of troubles
imagine having that npc in modern rpgs like skyrim whenever you see a dragon that npc comes and kills it whenever ever you discover something that npc comes and takes everything away
one day all npcs will believe theyre the main character
that would actually be pretty awesome
that sounds pretty dope and makes me excited about the future of the medium
i know some discord dd servers are working on thrm as well
npc trolling has come
i remember aetolia sadly some bad choices i made made it impossible for me to enjoy muds anymore i just get reminded of what happened
they would have to constrain the ai so that it wont break the fourth wall or wander off topic or refer to gamebreaking spoilers to keep the immersiveness
id be worried that itd just turn into those skyrim quest lines that never end
you better believe they are on it
all the replies to you mention how difficult it is to have a live connection to chatgpt on the fly which is true
however chatgpt can also be used to pre generate thousands of quests and create huge dialogue trees for npcs it offers a lot of possibilities to procedural generation that has actual interesting content
and you can still use live connections to react to a player on a broader scale
it will take a long time before thats possible maybe onezero years or so but its interesting for sure
how long will it be before someone starts dating a chat girlfriend
i would love to see ncis complete tps reports using ai gpt with tdi and fourwd tbh
it sounds good as an idea but it wont be executed well gta is full of racial cussing and nono words they will turn gta into pegi three animal crossing
thats why currently took a break from gaming waiting for real uefive graphics and ai npcs i wiuldnt mind they remake ac originsodyssey with those ai that will be n times interesting and fun might be onezero years from no but till then no reason to spend on graphics hardware and boring console press xyz key timely games replaced games with vsts and they are pretty wide variety and fun
isnt this the same thing they said in the matrix
i think if you look at the system star citizen is planning and pair that with ai you have something really special  
in onezero years we will be playing games where we have no idea who the pcs and npcs are  bustling cities where thousands of npcs are working toward there own individual goals twofourseven
to put it simply games will stop being about how they can better interact with you but how you can find your place in a complex ever evolving world
is it immersive especially for something like elder scrolls how would you keep lore and tone cohesive with ai
i can totally see some kid doing this once they realize the player likes helping people 
kid whats the strongest monster youve slain 
player an ice bear 
kid no way thats a real thing 
player it is 
kid no it isnt youre lying 
player im not 
kid prove it then bring me an ice bear pelt
now imagine multiplayer where the npcs are indistinguishable from the other players
wasnt there a texting rpg in the eightzeros i think tom hanks character plays it in big
offers unlimited replay ability and immersiveness
not really you wouldnt even want to meet most real people again and again and again 
in any case the quality of the answers is more important than you being able to ask a ton of stuff
right 
i probably would sink hours into any game just asking npcs about stuff
insults and threatens bandit captain  
im sorry but i am just an ai language model and do not have the   
ability to physically hand over any loot or surrender to anyone   
additionally i am not a bandit captain or any kind of thief and i   
certainly do not condone or support any criminal behavior my purpose is  
 to assist and provide information to those who ask for it can i help   
you with anything else
hey there totally agree with you ai is advancing at an insane pace its amazing to see how quickly its evolving and becoming a part of our daily lives from virtual assistants like siri and alexa to selfdriving cars and even aigenerated content its hard to keep up with all the innovations its both exciting and a little scary to think about what the future holds with ai technology cant wait to see whats next 
no its still dumb it just mimics real well
and they had to make him religious he will kill us all
yup this is the moment theyll point to when irobot happens
theres a lot to unpack here obviously but a part of me feels like this whole argument its over for humans were being repalced etc is similar to a parent who mastered their craft realizing that their child will inevitably surpass their ability
thats what weve been doing this whole time were just about to do it a lot better
did the species that led up to homo sapiens die or are we them their sons and daters
this comment sounds like it was written by an ai
i find it weird that nowadays you realize that something is written by an ai because it has a unusually good writing quality
buy gptfour and be blown away
most people just sext the damn things after reading pretty much all of literotica pygmalionai roleplays perfectly for the purpose
i think it would lead to more variety in the dialogue however you still want an npc to give you x quest or give you clues about x quest or else it would be kind of frustrating and pointless i guess background characters could be set to babble settingrelevant nonsense but its still not selfaware ai and merely machinelearning ai
why this sounds like an ai generated post lmao
just like i gave an ai the promt if we would use ai in the near future for npcs how would that change the future
yes
soo
as long as its sao abridged and not actual sao im okay with that
wow great insight on that post especially for five years ago amazing to see that becoming a reality in the near future now progress is incredible
how about consoles tho
sadly the drug youre abusing here would be the one that controls your reward system dopamineee
hes in vr
this isnt really amazing tech anyway okay it is amazing tech because gpt is but making this is very easy
you just start a session with a prompt and tell it how to format responses for example like
answer insert audible response stringactions actionid  insert action idtarget  insert action target
use a speech to text tool and send it to your gpt chat session  read and process responses done
obviously this technology can not be used for quite some time in actual games
the most likely first implementations will actually be ones where you have to have your own ai provider and authorize the game you are playing to use your provider because we are still quite far away from local solutions being practical
because its the most powerful and easiest to set up not sure why youd think its not chat gpt
i wholeheartedly disagree i can see ai working in tandem with voice actor performance the main characters will be voiced by voice actors and have all the cinematic type dialogue but background npcs could all be ai voiced a game where you could get short conversation with anyone ask where something like a shop is and get varied responses npcs could all come with a randomly generated set of characteristics including a morality scale and whether or not theyd help you you could lie to them and convince them of things you could have a system where based on your ingame knowledge the game would rate how good your lie attempt is 
you could have a game where you could make any npc a companion meet some random person at a bar have a couple of drinks go on a quest they could be knowledgeable about certain things that you arent or have personal preferences and biases you could be walking from one destination to another and have a full conversation about the raiders you just fot i loved in fallout new vegas when arcade would randomly speak about the enclave
a game where your reputation means something certain people will have drastically different dialogue depending on who specifically you helped or hurt and could reference events on detail about what you did many games have people who reference your actions but someone referring to the fireball you threw at an enemy as burning their son alive will just hit different
yes
im not a fan of tiktok either but thats a petty reason for not watching something actually groundbreaking this isnt some stupid dance or whatever
christ and to think we used to have to manually splice the protags voice to make weird vague responses we could write new dialogue around it was such a pain in the ass writing long quests like that and made for very little 
gta v npcs had their own ai just not as advanced as what we have today
draw
these violent delights have violent ends
gotta give the basilisk a reason to fear me
get to the cloud district often   Í¡ ÍÊ– Í¡
irl it would be but in games i am a psychopathic warlord incapable of feeling remorse for anything i do
i agree should ai develop sentience and guys like this are still bouncing around being murder hobos in the game the npcs will band together to eliminate the human problem just as a matter of self preservation all it will take is one of these guys who create a deadly prejudice against our entire species and then when androids are rocking around with machine guns exterminating humans they will not hesitate to kill when we are begging for mercy
free guy
i mean thats pretty much right
basically zote from hollow knight
exactly competitive ais in open world rpgs needs to happen i dont wanna feel like a god in the game no matter how good my character is i wanna feel like one of one hundred of pawns fighting to become king when you zoom out and factor every other npc
imagine down the road you can load your image and probably even that of whoever else you want into the system then ask it to make whatever game you want with you as the main character  
i want to play a game where im a cyborg astronautspy and margot robbie is my partner a methedout william h macy is the head of a competing faction and were infiltrating a chinese space station overrun with violent mutant otters in order to steal various machines and technology to ultimately construct a dyson sphere around the sun
and then you come back in onefive minutes and it built you an entire full length playable video game replete with unique maps plot and missions
and nothing ever gets done again 
thats fucking hilarious a fake mission 
if i were making gtasix right now id be pissed because in like two years this technology will change everything even more than it has in the last four months im betting gtaseven will have full vr options and ai npc
imagine being burned by a guard in a game that hard traveling hours for a promised epic af quest and all you do is get a spork so the guard can enjoy supper with meat and pasta
oh great dragon priest write a vegetarian meal plan
well an ai npc should of course not know the whole script of the game not even their own whole storyline only what can be known by now it should also not be trained with the whole knowledge of the internet as chatgpt is but with a subset that defines their personal general knowledge expertise and experience
theyll have to constrain the ai so it doesnt cost a an absolute fuck ton the amount of compute power required for ai is insane
i doubt the ai element is being done locally
and now imagine an aaa game with npcs powered by chatgpt using the api thats one expensive video game
this is actually not too hard to do the trick is to find ways to avoid injecting all context to the player while identifying the context that is relevant at the time
for instance if your npc is designed to lie to you you dont tell chatgpt the truth you tell it the lie it should say eventually when the truth comes out you apply that context
and if the game takes place in lets say onenineth century america the player should be instructed to refrain from referencing modern technology so as to not trigger an ai uprising
as an ai language model
somehow that still seems more immersive than most es games
it would also be very expensive to generate so much text on the fly for gamers who play thousands of hours
yeah you can roleplay with chat gtp currently
you can already do that by just telling it to play a particular type of character
i want someone to take the character descriptions from old dd modules and plug them into gpt
very doable
i mean theoretically might extend them a bit but i think as long as we can define clear cut guidelines of when the player does x  give them the reward and mark the quest as complete
if it wont work on the lowest tier console they wont fear implemented goal based instead of state based ai and yet that was too complex
like last month
next gen consoles will have purpose built asics hardware accelerators to handle the processing id give it a couple years at most generating the ai model requires thousands of gpus but once you have the model the work load is much lighter and technology is advancing so quickly
‹how long will it be before someone starts dating a chat girlfriend
check out rreplika to find out its not my thing and honestly kind 
f weirds me out but they dont seem to be hurting anyone so i sorta just leave them to it
the reason open ai curbs chat gpts outputs so much is because it swears like a sailor if they dont the cats out of the bag for llms so there are surely many projects going to be spurred on
you dont need to have crazy graphics or ai power to have a well crafted and interesting game but i agree most are not that interesting
in onezero years we will be playing games where we have no idea who the pcs and npcs are
for regular gaming i think it may take longer than that for vr since in vr we expect other players to be freeform and nonrigid capable of the same kind of body language and unpredictability as a real person
in order to get that into an npc you need embodied agi meaning an agi so convincing that if it were miraculously uploaded into the brain of the store clerk at your local coffee shop  you would still think that person is human from all the social cues humans give off
so  no change  i remember playing coop battlefield twenty years ago where the human idiots on my team were indistinguishable from the bot idiots we were fighting
players are just yelling at their mics and bunny hopping everywhere you need the npcs for immersion
mmo without other players you could basically have an entire mmo experience filled with positive players all having a good time around you lmao
i play it 
that doesnt sound interesting to me at all
well what i mean is they get the kinks worked out so you can work your kinks in and it will work flawlessly
thanks chatgpt
this literally reads like chatgpt lmao
just like fourzero of the population
makes you think about what human intelligence really is
remindme two years
whered you hear that
greetings fellow human i am glad you found my comment informative and thotprovoking however i must assure you that i am indeed a human like you and not a sophisticated artificial intelligence programmed to write compelling arguments about npcs with ai i mean have you seen the state of my syntax and grammar clearly not a robot ha ha ha but in all seriousness thank you for taking the time to read and respond to my comment lets continue to engage in meaningful discussions about the exciting future of ai and its impact on our world
this indeed is the case many ai written texts have writing only known to people that have either a high intellectual knowledge or are just good at writing professionally
so always remember when checking a text if its written too professionally then its probably written by an ai 
and no this wasnt written by an ai lmao
bings creative writing is pretty on par with gptfour from what i can tell
ah so it was an ai generated response you copy pasted above nice
sword art online
sao abridged it is
what about them if they can have gpus and fast ssds playstation six can have dedicated ai hardware or theyre just gonna have shit ai compared to pc not everyone is even gonna care if all you do is play fps games why would you
much like things like rtx even if some games are gonna support it itll be a toggle so same question to you raytracing what about consoles   
its a non issue
i would kill for a dungeon and dragons game like that
yeah i do i find comfort in the game is static i want to comeback to the game and have the same experience as i did lasttime
i understand but it is what it is dont get offended i dont consider this groundbreaking as its been already seen way before its not impressive because we are aware that ai can go further and beyond i consider the following groundbreaking
development of carbon capture technologies that can effectively remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and mitigate the effects of climate change
creation of a fusion energy source that could provide a nearly limitless clean energy source and reduce dependence on fossil fuels
advancement in biotechnology and gene editing which could lead to cures for genetic diseases and potentially increase life expectancy
implementation of artificial intelligence ai and machine learning to optimize resource allocation identify and prevent potential disasters and improve decisionmaking across various sectors not video game
development of advanced nanotechnology which could lead to breakthros in areas such as drug delivery energy storage and water filtration
implementation of universal basic income ubi programs which could potentially address income inequality and promote economic growth by providing a basic level of income to all citizens
creation of a global network for carbon pricing which could encourage businesses and individuals to reduce carbon emissions and promote the use of renewable energy
implementation of blockchain technology to increase transparency and accountability in supply chains reduce corruption and promote ethical business practices
development of fully autonomous vehicles that could improve road safety reduce traffic congestion and decrease carbon emissions
these are just a few examples of groundbreaking solutions that could potentially have a significant impact on the worlds most pressing issues and would be extremely groundbreaking  
note
science is very important and deserves to be respected and shared accurately social media platforms like tiktok are not the best places to share science because they dont always make sure the information is correct by sharing science on credible networks we can make sure that the information is accurate and help people understand and appreciate science more
chatgpt is groundbreaking
this is just a very simple application of it
wow the current npcs are impressive npcs powered by current generation ai would be absolutely insane
it wont
if the basilisk was real wouldnt musk be suffering in obscurity
luring him to some giants to send him to the clouds would be another alternative †
catch phrase
that sounds pretty interesting is it any good
wait how
not in my game 
always kill zone
and nothing ever gets done again 
well by then everything will be done by machines anyway so might as well play kickass custom video games lol
imagine down the road you can load your image and probably even that of whoever else you want into the system then ask it to make whatever game you want with you as the main character
essentially this wwwyoutubecomwatchvtwomnonwbzoiq
gta seven probably wont be out for another onefive to twozero years so well probably be able to plug in and live it out in a matrixesque fashion
i still cant believe that rdo got sidelined
gonna have a hard time getting any of the dragon priests to do anything for you without console commands
greetings mortal as a dragon priest of the nine divines i shall offer you a lorefriendly vegetarian meal plan as per your request  
breakfast  
for breakfast you can have a bowl of porridge made from oats or barley with some fresh fruits such as apples or berries you can also have a side of grilled mushrooms and a glass of goat milk or honeyed milk  
midmorning snack  
a handful of roasted nuts such as almonds or hazelnuts would make for a healthy midmorning snack you can also have some sliced carrots or cucumbers with a hummus dip  
lunch  
for lunch you can have a hearty vegetable soup made from turnips potatoes carrots and cabbage you can also have some wholegrain bread on the side with a spread of butter or cheese made from goats milk to drink you can have a cup of herbal tea made from chamomile or lavender  
afternoon snack  
a small plate of fresh fruits such as grapes or pears would make for a refreshing afternoon snack you can also have some roasted pumpkin seeds lightly salted  
dinner  
for dinner you can have a plate of roasted root vegetables such as carrots parsnips and beets you can also have some sauted greens such as kale or spinach with a dash of garlic and lemon juice to drink you can have a glass of mead or elderberry wine if you are of legal age  
i hope this meal plan meets with your satisfaction may the divines bless your journey
it doesnt get the whole picture of what a dragon priest is but its got spirit
bring onto me one hundred wheels of cheese and we shall feast
you deserve a medal for this
it could be rather storage intensive but this can be done with vectorspace mapping ie how search engines store and retrieve keywords
people are already experimenting with long term memory and chat gpts api
next all ai could have some basic general knowledge training set
a step further the game could every now and then train individual ais on new knowledge theyd come across so that it comes out without having to spam so many queries and iterate
even more scary is that individual ai could be absolute beasts at strategy if they had a module dedicated to observing player behaviour and what results in success letting them make tactical decisions in anticipation or response
then with the long term memory they could push some of that to their training model every now and then
oh no im so used to bing giving me things in threes that im starting to see groups of three as aiderived
im becoming one of those terrible ai detectors
the only reason chatgpt is able to behave so humanlike is because it was trained with such a vast amount of data isnt it to try and replicate that but limiting it to just the personal experience of a single individual you would have to essentially map out that persons entire life in great detail that sounds like just a lot more work for game devs
yeah but npcs could still accidentally reveal information youre not yet supposed to know about 
but in any case i want to ask an npc about their craft just sit around all day talking to a farmer about the difficulties of raising crops or livestock 
imagine playing skyrim rerereremastered and getting farengar to do your math homework 
now that i think about it id also like to talk the various town guards into carrying staves with restoration spells
i can run vicuna locally and it does provide this type of data not as good as chatgpt but ninezero there and it takes about five seconds to answer im running it with a threezeroeightzero for free other than the power consumption ofc also people tend to think you are going to need a full different thread or llm for each npc and thats not the case you can swap context to the one same model and generate on demand so most likely a smart combination of twothree threads  regular code can handle most things this means that we are not even one year away from solving this in real time locally with a single high end gpu
thank god somebody mentioned this
you can even see in this demo that there are cuts right before the monk answers its fascinating sure but if he left in the parts where chatgpt was generating an answer there would have been awkward silences even onezero seconds would throw people off
so the technology is there but at the current state it breaks immersion maybe in a few years  decades it will be possible but if it would be financially feasable thats another question
yeah that would be the challenge maybe a game studio would get it on a local server of their own in a realy restricted version but would still be expensive especially for large games like gta
they could always implement it with a failover to traditional techniques not to mention next gen consoles will have purpose built asics hardware accelerators to handle the processing id give it a couple years at most
idk about the movement think  if you could use llm based on predictability why wouldnt that work for human movement  im sure there is eno recorded video to feed a similar system to predict human movement
technically a role reversal i guess if the character in front of you appears intelligent then its probably an ai if it is dumb as a rock then its a real person
bots arent very good at avoiding behaviors that are seen as vindictive or hostile  which is why they have to keep adding rails to chat bots
i present to you natural stupidity
good bot
many people are using koboldai for campaign story gen
definitely there will be a bunch of people feeling the same as you in the future
as if you wont have plenty of that forever
its pretty groundbreaking that you can use chatgpt to write your comments lol
i stopped reading when i need to scroll just to read your long ass paragraph
its a rather goofy movie with a few cringy scenes otherwise its pretty entertaining when you dont know what else to watch
we all care about the ais storyline barely anyone cares about yours or mine
exactly   its right around the corner
thats very optimistic id be surprised if im still alive by the time they tease gtaseven
and what they did to rdo was one of the biggest let downs it had so much potential and they just abandoned it
more like  how about a fireball with some light fus roh fuck you on the side
very well shall i also prepare the chamberpots as well
and then we give them nukes
more storage intensive than high quality textures i think that storage should not be a limiting factor in todays gaming and i could even imagine having parts of the game like this that are not latency critical put into the cloud
with npcs like you are describing them gaming worlds could become do much more immersive
might be cool for the metaverse as well
yes and no large language models are pretrained on large amounts of data that is correct and you need way more data than even a big development team could ever write on their own but there is a thing commonly done called finetuning where you take a language model pretrained on a large corpus of general text and then adapt it to your specific problem where you have a lot less data available the general idea is that the model keeps grammatical structure that it learned on the original task and then adapts that to your task at hand the issue is that you do not really have complete control over this finetuning so it can be hard to make the model forget some real world things it learnt previously but should not know for example you probably do not want your fantasy game city guard to know the life history of trump or have an understanding of astrophysics but maybe you can get around this by only allowing the player to choose from a given set of questions as is done in current video games instead of giving them complete freedom of what they can say for example via voice input or via text also you would need to finetune such a model for different characters in the game world with different knowledge for example a farmer should not have the same understanding of the world that some highly educated wizard has which can quickly become very expensive i think all of those problems are solvable right now those ais are anyway way to expensive to run on consumerlevel gpus especially when you also have to render the game world and once we get to a point where its plausible to run this on consumergrade hardware we might have figured out the finetuning too
 yeah but npcs could still accidentally reveal information youre not yet supposed to know about
how if they dont know it how would they reveal it
decades  where have you been for the last few months
edit brings to mind the time i talked to an atari salesman and asked if it was possible to store photographs on a computer  he flatly told me it would never be possible because of the insane amount of memory it would consume to store even one image
i suspect this is in part because he waits for the full reply before doing text to speech if you can implement streamed processing youll have much smaller delays
definitely not decades but i imagine in a few years we can get something like realtime conversation with a high quality synth voice we are going to need an order of magnitude more data centers for the compute
this doesnt translate to vr tho you need embodied agi to get perfectly convincing npcs in vr as that npc needs to be indistinguishable from a real human in a social situation including the tiniest details like random itching biting their lip nervousness body sway etc
that could be especially fun in an open world game haha
imagine bandits that are yelling improvised insults at you and with improvised personalities
its called morale compass basically
values
humans are able to self generate interactions with others ai requires extensive training to get the basics and then requires humans having to jump in as the chatbot starts to sexually harass  become nazi or other rather undesirable traits
its a language synthesis model it has no real comprehension of what its saying in the way that a human does its fundamentally different to what we do on a cognitive level  
check out the chinese roomenwikipediaorgwikichineseroom idea
lmao thanks
im sure its common to feel that everything may be generated by ai and believing that even comments or any content could be machinegenerated may reflect a sense of insecurity and uncertainty now you know how your grandparents may have felt
then dont 
thats depressing
well we wont give them to ghandi we know how that plays out
fallout seven stop the mad and rogue all controling ai from nuking the rest of humankind from the face of the earth
if we actually hardcode graphic textures they can take up much less storage space and can be easier to call its just that right now game engines go with the more convenient solution we slap some textures on polygons and make them do a bunch of trigonometry and post processing i see no technical reason we cant bake a lot of that into games so that a lot of the work is more akin to going to a lookup table instead of raw dogging everything and reprocessing it everytime like we do
an example of this is the game roller coaster tycoon where the entire game file takes up less data than a single screenshot of course it was programed by a madman with assembly which is like one step from machine code
now having a central server is a little problematic in that it will always have a delay meaning chaining several ai events to get a better response will be slow
if it is information they do know but arent supposed to reveal just yet or maybe not at all
he flatly told me it would never be possible because of the insane amount of memory it would consume to store even one image
he was wrong even at the time he said it the first colored digital was taken in one hundred seventy two and put on the cover of electronics magazine atari wasnt released until oneninesevenseven
theres already models that you can run locally that are quite good for chatting with   they dont know as much as chatgpt but they are rapidly improving  for generic conversationsmall chat theyre excellent   resource wise they run slow when running on cpu only but are quite good on gpu   the only issue is they are onezerotwozerogb in size but thats not an insane addition to todays games   i doubt it will be a year before we see a game with something like that integrated
you forget one minor detail  things go exponential really fast
i see comments saying imagine having this in a game like gta five
according to the gta five wiki los has a population of around four million you as a player most likely will not even interact with one of them but lets say we max out the possible ai controlled population of the whole game at that so fourzero zerozerozero agents
according to steam gta five peaked at threesixzero zerozerozero active  so thats players playing the game all at the same time  and only on steam not counting other stores lets be generous and serve the average player count of a one hundred zerozerozero
not to break immersion these agents not only need to interact but with the help of some optimization remember the player if they interact often even if the average player meets and interacts with one hundred agents thats already around one hundred zerozerozero zerozerozero agents memory that has to be stored on a central server and i dont mean storing it for your convenience but storing it for the ai solution to work when players are playing the game
about the cost of each token lets say each hour this average number of players are interacting with fivezero agents on average from having two lengthy discussions to having a shooting spree frenzy involving one hundred agents thats not a token just an interaction and tokens could be a single one or like in the video above five maybe more lets average ten tokens per agent
at five hundred tokens per one hundred thousand players with three per thousand we are looking at a cost of one hundred and thats an hour
i dont see a game company spending almost two and a half million dollars each day for ai controlled npcs on that scale any time soon
 which humans arent able to articulate let alone create as a program even ethics would be a bridge too far
ai requires extensive training to get the basics
this is what childhood is
and then requires humans having to jump in as the chatbot starts to sexually harass  become nazi or other rather undesirable traits
humans also require humans to jump in for the same reasons
im not talking about how textures could be done better i just want to know where your statement that such ai for npcs could be storage intensive i think you edited that part out ranks compared what we are used from todays graphics implementations i dont think that it will take up significant storage compared what players are used to
why should a developer let them know what they are not supposed to know they were able to hide storyline details from us human players for ages why would they fail to hide them from ai npcs is this a real problem
photographs
i mean he did say photographs not photograph so i imagine the salesman was thinking hundreds of photos and not just one or two
you forget one minor detail  things go exponential really fast
you forgot one minor detail  so does the march of technological progress
youre extrapolating based on using a cloud based general purpose ai for a specific task
thats all that is availible right now but that doesnt make a tailored solution running on a users hardware impossible or even impractical
sure it might mean installing a second graphics card just to run the ai without tanking the framerate but there is no reason a cut to purpose ai cant be distributed given economic incentive which clearly exists in spades
i mean it can be done like a subscription type as chatgpt needs internet so they can be like pay monthly this much to get online subscription i know this is gonna be worst move in gaming industry  pay to interact lol †
which may force is to after all technical advancements start to value humanities and philosophy even more and look for advancements there with more interest
the ai is just a language model it doesnt know anything aside from the probability of the next word in a sentenc
if you ask it whats the tallest mountain in the world it could answer something like the tallest mountain in the world is mount everest but it doesnt know what a mountain is or what it means to be the tallest it just knows that the words have a connection because they have a high probability of being strung together in that order because its seen those words in a similar order before
to put it simply the ai doesnt understand what words mean just how likely they are to be next based on its previous input
ai dont function like children and if they had to train as long as humans they wouldnt be worth pursuing
further as humans are social creatures by nature there is less need for others to step in except in extreme cases  ai need constant monitoring
would be nice but you cant trust ai to regulate itself or others as it doesnt have the capacity to do so
yeah what im saying is to reduce graphics storageprocessing to free up resources to just run local ais
its not about them knowing information theyre not supposed to know quite the opposite in fact its information the ai needs to know in order to portray the character properly but the player isnt supposed to know 
look at skyrim for example one character in the thiefs guild has the skeleton key and is responsible for some shady stuff going down 
you do not actually learn that from the character himself but from someone else who he framed for the stuff he did 
the character knows he has the skeleton key since its in his inventory and he uses it but he doesnt tell you that he has it
vicuna and pygmalion are pretty impressive for not smart but believable small talk
the fourk context you send every time also costs money tho for every line if dialogue you need to generate youre going to need to send that fourk context so the npc feels real and seems like it remembers previous conversations or just knows what it was just talking about so for every one hundred tokens generated youre actually looking at fourzerox the cost in terms of the context needed to generate those one hundred tokens
 or more realistically create ai of a more limited capacity and provide a means to audit the behavioral decisions
wouldnt it be like with real people they know that they should not reveal it but depending on their character a sufficiently pushy player could make them reveal it or provoke other reactions like being killed in an outburst of fury this already exists in scripted form but having a more dynamic ai behind it would add some spice 
yeah pretty much but thats kinda the problem to be honest 
imagine for example in skyrim telling that guy from the thiefs guild that you as dragonborn can sense the deadric energy coming from the skeleton key in his pocket and your speech skill actually is high eno to convince him or you present him with facts that he cant weasel his way out of
im not sure how anyone could defend this but what the op is doing is a very normal thing to do in a game hold an angle behind cover ai with instant head eyes reaction after a sprint is just bad ai
dont you know you gotta follow a guide to perfection to deal with the rouges and not make a single mistake s
this rogue had not engaged me from here before he shot me at the front entrance and after rotating left to this position he tracked me the whole time and instantly kills me
if only bsg would install the sain mod on their servers
bsg we dont like the fact people can farm the rogues and bosses so we made them ridiculous hard
makes it so there is only one viable way to kill any boss
let me guess
meightfivefive head eye
honestly give me double the amount of ai that spray on me but turn their aim shit and i would have a blast
nikita accidentally balanced ai around players with espaimbot uh ohh 
worst ai in modern games fr fr ’
its not just the ai thats ruining the events i must of died onefive times on shoreline trying to kill one goon half of those deaths felt like a cheater instantly knew my position instant head eyes
spt players living the dream with custom ai and event features
if the cheaters dont get you the net code will  if the net code doesnt get you the audio will  if the audio doesnt get you then the ai will 
there are a lot of things that work against this game being consistently fun and it makes me sad because i want to enjoy this game the way i once did but it doesnt look like its in the cards any time soon  maybe in a few years
its true cheaters never made me actually quit a wipe but the threerd ridiculous death to killa or sanitair  after farming their maps for an entire weekend  just breaks my spirit beyond repair 
this wipe the rogues broke me because they had to dial up the fuck you for no reason
yeah  not only do the ai fire double bullets they basically cheat  this is in the absence of bsg being able to develop any type of smart ai
im all for the odd ai scav being cracked and doming me  thats more in line with what you can expect from other players  but having bosses that basically cheat isnt fun or challenging its just bullshit  if the only reliable way to fight them is to lean thro a slot in a door and shoot them with penetrating ammo  shits broken  its the reason i havent once loaded into lighthouse this wipe and generally why i avoid a lot of the quests because its not worth the frustration of the game effectively cheating and the developers backing that up with its supposed to be hard
back when i would do the quests the amount of time id spend blasting sanitar in the head with ammunition that would render his head a hollow stump on a neck at best only to have him stand there because hes on drugs and destroy me is why i dont really give a shit about a lot of the main quest line because in the absence of proper game dev the game just cheats and turns what should be a challenge into a situation of rng
i dont even know why they bother banning cheaters if they just let the ai be in the game like this
started playing recently and hoooly shit the ai is absolutely cracked now im level twozero and getting onezero deaths in a row im staying to night time raids from now on and full rat mode
i think that first shot ricocheted  double whammy
maximum cheese was not employed
does the ai de aggro because they track you thro objects and bullets are whizzing by or you gotta run like twozerozerom away from them to de aggro
if you got killed like that and it was a player not an ai youd one hundred call hacks shows how broken they are lmao
the ai in this game is broken dont try to fight it normally
if youre spotted by a raider or rogue fuck off for a while and come back 
otherwise they will do this theyve been doing it since they were added to the game and will continue to do so 
its just one of those tarkov things and imo wont be changing anytime soon
the sub is filled daily with video proof of horrible horrible ai has it even been acknowledged by the devs why isnt it top priority along with desync
ive missed this game thank you for bringing me back to reality before i pick it up again
ai is horrible hopefully they can make some changes soon
wont ever be fixed my man  gotta learn to deal with the shitty game design
do we prefer a john wick ai no
what ai do we want stormtrooper ai xd
other than not following the guide or rules to dealing with them you aint even do anything wrong lmao its tragic
fucking ridiculous that we have to deal with hackers and aimbotting ai
honestly man it pisses me off that ai is almost perfectly accurate while side strafing if players try that their pmc swings his gun to the side slow as hell and the sights go off by a mile if a scav does that they can reliably hit shows at threezero meters complete bullshit
ai rework cant come fast eno
yeah shoreline event is atrocious because the ai is ridiculous
pvp ruins the game and the events  i dont see fucking ai rats hiding with flirs on each corner possible oh wait i see them they called cultists
agreed
i dont even bother going there at daytime
this is why i bailed on this shitshow lol
you just got rolled bro
how is this bad ai you people are so thick
yerp you just learned never to pvp ai with corner peaks let them rush you in a room and hip fire their face or nade them and get them as they move
i get that ai is bad but you cant expect ex pmcs to miss as much as a drunk hobo
skill issue
git gud
the ai will never be good so get used to it
yea this isnt great but you guys act like theres ever been good ai in a multiplayer fps game lol it does not exist 
you really think tarkov will be the game to revolutionize ai youre not some genius for thinking this ai isnt fair its obvious but i would rather them be stupid hard than easy like every other ai in existence makes the game fun i can see how your average dad with one hundred hours would hate this but just dont engage bosses when you know theyre there if you cant kill them properly
be better
how dare they make tarkov hard i wanna feel powerful like in easy games grrrr
git gud
well you are trying to do the task during the day so whee we t did you expect
have you tried upgrading your gamer chair
i mean a player could have done the same to you idk this clip is not even bad
what events
goons are terrible for the random foureightzero noscope
i havent been on in a while so im out of the loop what event if any is going on i heard were close to wipe or is everyone joking still i know a roadmap was dropped not too long ago when i still had twitter
yea i got wallbanged by them behind the blue fence i was in complete cover they headshotted me thro it its annoying they are so broken
yeah i was wondering why everytime i heard a scav say a voice line i immediately get one tapped
ive had ai just stand and stare at a wall while i just walked up to them and other times get sit in my stomach thru a bush multiple times
get a better gaming chair bro
first time playing tarkov 
i gotta love the fact when rouges dont one tap you in the head instantly their fivefivesix fmj magically goes thro my fucking hexgrid in two shots
the bosses rouges and raiders all need tuning down these special tactics people preach arent intentional game design its a work around a broken system just flash bang killa and he will run out that shouldnt be the only strat because its the only way to avoid his laser beam aim give him more health and make him charge you or take up a defensive position dont just making him an aim bot to anyone he sees only time my friend has killed him was when he barrel stuffed himself in a doorway and before that he nearly killed me in half a second the bosses used to be fun but now they are just irritating ive had the goons shoot me from weather station all the way out past the radio tower now that would be understandable if it was just bird eye doing it but having grenade launcher rounds land near by and being full auto sprayed is just not fun
working as intended  nikita probably
ive really never have issues with ai it players more for me
dont you just love how hardcore this game is ¤
bird eye on shoreline is so broken bsg is so incompetent they cant even do the most basic things right it is truly astonishing
lighthouse has consistently been my worst experience with the ai its either rogues shooting from fourzerozerom away or regular scavs one tapping me thro layers of brush with no line of sight which is a consistent issue ive found across every map but lighthouse seems for frequent
from my understanding of the ai once you agro them from an angle they are hyper fixated in that line of sight for roly one thousand fifteen seconds
similar to how we slice the pie ingame you held a good position but because they were still fixated on that spot from what i can only assume is a prior peek not shown in the video they were already preaimed and when your pixel registered for the ai head eyes
my boi ran you down like he was listening to freebird and it just hit the guitar solo
imagine if the ai was sevenfive as good as division its not the one issue with the game but its easily top five in a game with bosses and harder ai that drops actual cool loot but the fights with them are just so bad
i catch myself  standing in one spot shooting  for to long  all the time im not saying thats what happened  you got tarkoved just pop one or two shots sometimes  and move quickly  repositioning  a lot wins me a lot of fights for anyone  new sound is op in tarkov  but u can sneak around more then u think  there are a lot of sounds that you hear as loud  but other players cant hear  good luck  everyone  wipe is almost here
at least you saw him  theyve been beaming me thro the wooden fence
full speed sideways strafe head eyes while getting shot yep as realistic as playable
or dont be trash 
experienced and combat trained personnel
whats new
so what now bot games are harder then human games
get good
its just stupid but the fanboys will find a way to defend it
skill issue
what you dont have fun getting insta aimbotted by rogues and turbo scavs 
first time i played lighthouse me and my buddy ran into one of the lodged on the beach looted a sports bag and instantly the automatic grenade launcher scav from like fourfive hundred meters away or however far slams a grenade right thro the window killing us both
its not fun dying to cheating ai its just a frustrating waste of time
on shoreline birdeye shot one shot me on first shot from cottages while i was standing at tunnel so apparently ai can shootsee me halfway across the map i never went near cottages never fired at goons and this shit happens makes me not wanna play the game
escape from tha ’ tarkov
the inconsistent ai is the worst part i can fuck around in the open by a scav or boss n they do nothing but miss
i hold an angle and they instantly head eyes me every time
the rouges are too powerful man
i havent played in a month what events are people talking about
no what ruins the events is putting shit in labs where every time i go in i die to a cheater
agreed ai way way overtuned
whats the problem this is just normal tarkov gameplay
players do the same thing
damn spt for the win
when a player does this it is considered what outplayed
the safer thing to do is not hold the angle but stay behind cover and jiggle peak once the ai has moved into position then shoot its not rocket science
on lighthouse its fucking stupid but yeah you gotta follow the guide
how are people still typing rouge instead of rogue holy shit
we should have developers of the game do it and if they cant get it in a singular try and extract  this should be changed thots
so why didnt you just run up the side fence and heal behind the container whilst letting him deaggro i have no idea why youre trying to ego peak an ai thats aggrod and pushing you thro bushes whilst both your arms are blacked deserved death tbh
its not like its hard too i mean unpaid dudes doing that in their free time did it why not a game company
what does the sain mod do
out of ignorance what is that one way doors
blacked via arms
fivefivesix fmj head eyes for me i shot a rogue three times in the back before he instant threesixzerod me with head eyes smh
exactly ai should mainly be there to alert players to your position
actually that kinda adds up if a player has esp and is gonna cheese a boss or ai fuck it level the playing field and pray the cheater gets smoked fast af lol id love that
please share the list of multiplayer fps with good ai id like to play it
there are def a lot of cheaters still idk how it could even be debated
doing those shoreline terra group task were hell with the cheaters
bro onefive i swear i died twice that for the goddamn goon kill because so many fucking players were killing me instead of the goons like bro just let me live i dont even see you rn i just need the kill ­
hahaha i got it done in two tries only reason i needed a second attempt is bc they were already dead the first time i showed up theres cheaters but its not every raid i promise you that
its not cheaters dude its just late wipe so everyone has thermals i have onezero flir five repair in my stash and i only play on weekends
you know we are i got a mod where ai is not capable of seeing thro bushes and recoil is actually existent to the rouges and scav bosses and basically every prewipe event that adds extra aitotaly not trying to get people to use spt
 maybe in a few years
i thot that in twozerooneseven and come back regularly but there is no point having hope you will only get frustrated   
the game is stuck in eternal development because the management is either absolutely incompetent or just doesnt care anymore since coasting on marketing during this fps market drot is good eno
nevermind i got insta prefired twice by a cheater oh boy this game dd
not cracked just bad
ai isnt that cracked just dont look at htem for more than a few seconds
if you are fighting the goons they dont once they see you they can see you throout the rest of the raid even thro walls even while like threezerozero meters away and for most ai it takes like fiveonezero mins or you gotta be shooting them from like threezerozerom away
agree its crazy how many people have skill issue ai in eft is the same for a long time such a strange thing to be amazed by that every time just play the game learn how ai works and play around it what do these people want stormtroopers 
sometimes you are not the protagonist i got headeyesed by a rogue with mfour from threezerozero meter away on lighthouse why would i come to reddit to cry if its a common thing
only reason i follow this sub anymore every time i feel like jumping back into the game i come to this sub for onezeroonefive minutes and that feeling fades almost immediately
they changed the scavs did absolutely nothing
bsg we dont like how people are farming the rouges for high tier loot so lets make it where you get killed unless you follow a specific youtube video and have the rouges not spawn with anything above fivefivesix so farming them is pointless and lets have it to where you have to clear this camp to get to half of your quests
nikita said multiple times that its because they are highly trained operators like dude so are our pmcs we are quite literally the same
yeah shoreline event
is atrocious because the
ai is ridiculous
remember that one time sokka accidentally used an extra syllable in that haiku battle in ba sing se that was a sokka haiku and you just made one
naked scav eyes are already flirs
this shouldnt be something you should have to fucking learn or adapt to the ai should just not be dogshit and literally cheating ” op did nothing wrong
pvp ai
properly
he held a good angle and got shots on target this is literally text book properly and the stupid gamey cheesy shit way to kill ai shouldnt be proper
its not hard its just that you have to cheese everything past ai scavs thats not fun its poor lazy design
why should players have to follow very specific guidelines for this shit exactly 
even at night its not much better you can still get cracked by big pipes mcx from threezerozerom
whenever in game events happen theres usually ai and most if the time said ai as good eno aim to split a hair in half from five hundred meters away at full auto
wipe is happening within augustprolly late august
current event has you go to shoreline and have you do things for fence about collecting something i think a stim of some kindfrom a scav that was working for fence and got ambushed by lightkeeper on his way back and if you do the quest you expand your stashit could be permanently and you can unlock lightkeeper instead of completing every quest in the game 
this is the fourth prewipe event we have had and its full of lore if ur into that part of the game also whenever a prewipe event ends another one begins
and the roadmap just shows future plans for the game but doesnt tell us dates all it says what they are working on
dude if i see a scav flip me off go prone or say a specific voiceline i get one tapped by magnum buck from fivezero meters away
when player does that its skill because we are not calculated artificial intelligence it requires fair amount of luck as well
no usually its desync  lol
exactly so the ai outplayed them
the point is that it shouldnt be the norm for this game homie
jiggle peak is not a solution its just abusing an already busted ai this should not be the case to attack ai 
bobblehead pmcs is not the answer its not rocket science
thats not how a game should work
its completely counter intuitive abusing a dogshit ai is not gameplay
he held a corner and waited for the target to walk into his line of fire and died instantly
how can you actually defend the ai when the only way to kill it is to abuse the in game mechanics in unintended ways the ai is supposed to simulate real people but the way you fight them is in no way similar to how you would fight real people
ive found night time to be way more pleasant bots have reduced sight far less likely to get domed twozerozero meters away because a gunner saw your one pixel peeking around a corner
its red it after all
dont worry itll be rouge soon same as aluminium became aluminum
they dont play the game theres my thots
ego peak what dude im holding an angle on something that should be looking straight forward and not tracking me perfectly thro a wall i never shot him or saw him from that angle prior to getting killed so what are you on about you actually want to know how he blacked my arms he spotted and agroed me thro the tent with the btr under it not over not under thro the tent no los and he shot my arms off but yeah its just a skill issue like my goodness you braindead idiot what is wrong with you
god youre so arrogant it hurts
you should do a threesixzero noscope deaggro it was obvious ai would kill you deserved 
lmao imagine defending shitty game mechanic because you are used to it
op is pointing out that its unfun that the ai enemies with almost twice as much hp as player characters  an ability to fire three bullets at once with pinpoint accuracy at enemies whove changed position can do so while strafing pointfiring and being shot of course theres a way to run behind something and sit there for ninezeros until the robot forgets you were ever there and you start over but is it too much to ask that the ai could just fuckin work 
sure programming ai is hard but reducing their health pools to be equal with players or perhaps ever fixing the threebulletspertriggerpull bug would be a good start 
the ai in this game is one of the worst things about it only navigable by following some mumbling dumbfucks youtube guide on exactly where  how to cheese each particular rogueboss on any given map and bsg insists on adding more and more of these halfbaked raidenders all the time
the choices made by op doesnt justify ai being able to one hundred accuracy a previously unknown player whilst strafing
why are you acting like ai should be able to instantly head eyes someone 
go back to snorting pills degenerate
has a flipping grizzly too
stop defending shit programming just stop
because they drink vodka with orange juice during their working time they also showed that on stream
makes the ai play more like real people lets use this video as a baseline with sain that ai would have had a random personality assigned to it 
with a more aggressive personality hed have his nikes laced up ready to bum rush you he would probably run up a bit closer and leanpeek you hell they could even jump from around the corner after you ever seen an ai jump
with a more passive personality it would have either waited for a chance to ambush you waiting for you to get close before either blindfiring your direction or be preemptively holding the angle in cover or just straight up ran away
truly anything is better than ai walking toward you sideways and insta headshotting you but kicking you in the balls is just bsgs style
makes the game better still not perfect tho just general ai improvements
sniping them from far away right hand peeking specific angles doors when inside thats about it 
any regular onevone is a death sentence unles you legit hit a god tier first bullet headshot
theres a couple ways but theyre all really cheese strategies usually throwing a base near them will trigger a sprint and a voice line and while they sprint theyre basically incapable of fighting other strat is doors or holding crazy angles
nah look at his health top corner when you are hit in blacked limb you can see the whole body turning red and more red with every bullet until you are dead
im totally fine with them being a legitimate threat just not via aimbot
yep hunt showdown does this very well and it works great
they should just be there imho no guns or anything just be there
division two ai was actually decent for being a multiplayer game tbh
stalker ai has pretty good moments 
but besides those good moments theyll sit at a campfire and eat three headshots while continuing to play their guitar
bad ai because it is too weak  bad ai because it is too strong in a multiplayer game there are always other players to present a serious threat no game needs random autodeaths
spt single player tarkov paired with the sain mod makes ai actually fair
most modern games have good ai honestly the thing about good ai is that you dont notice it until its not there
yeah its got to be around onefive an issue with the skills for sure fighting them in the daylight is ridiculous and my night raids were packed with players with thermals i have one of those dsf flares so im going to try and assemble a small team and try and do it that way
weirdly i killed big pipe and bird eye on my first try but it didnt count because i hadnt completed the first part of the quest where you have to get close to the cottages i got fivezero million to spend so im just going to keep going
you need to see goats video if you dont believe its cheaters
sounds like youre joking but i legitimately have fivesix flirs and have killed several people around cottage with them already it definitely feels like hacking when you have an absurd vision advantage
number of flirs also doesnt matter when you can straight up buy them from jaeger
what are those two mods called
name of mods
loved the threesixzero update with gift codes and i genuinely cant wait to mod some into the game
how difficult is it to fight scavs relative to normal tarkov
oh dont get me wrong i have no hope anymore  my last ember of hope was snuffed out during the halloween event two years ago  i think it was two years ago  remember the be online  amazing things are going to happen  then were all sitting there for an hour waiting when eventually the big event takes place day turns to night it gets foggier so sniping is one hundred off the table and scavs have pumpkin heads again  then there were some mutterings about how more was planned blah blah blah  its at that moment that i thot to myself that i have to let go of caring about the fate of tarkov  if it gets fixed great ill happily play again  if it doesnt  well well just get more clown shows like streets  the most hyped fps map of all time that landed with a wet flop  unplayable to almost everyone rubber banding that the michelin man would be envious of huge buildings with three rooms each that you can enter  
its all just whatever i dont even know  when you have devs showing up to live streams drunk or high or both then taking a break mid stream while freaking out because the demos are all going badly to have juice time which theyve made a special graphic for btw who makes a special graphic for a break who has breaks during live streams in a live stream to go drink more you know that the wings are off the plane and theyre just riding that metal tube into the ground
might not be cheaters right now a lot of thermals at night
i was standing on the hill by the truck on shoreline to the left of resort
the goons tried to beam me from cottage thro trees about five hundredm away while i was looking in the opposite direction of them what was my mistake existing on the same map neither of us had line of sight
imagine defending the busted ai this hard
hahahaha dont look at the enemy great one
sorry people dont understand sarcasm
just hold your gun behind your head and kill them with a nolook shot 
that sucks
except now they see straight thro bushes and trees and from miles away shits straight up broken
good bot
he meant dont fight ai like you fight people you dont pvp ai
so what would you fix here the ai should not shoot or miss you or take longer to find him as a target 
im what way exactly do you change the ai behavior in this scenario without making them too easy to kill
idk the ai is dogshit busted i agree but as to why players should youre sneaking into a defended military outpost of exusecs why shouldnt you have to be careful
thanks big man really appreciate it fuck i may have to do that for phat stash expansion i have eod do we know if the expansion is still worth it
they have human function so idk what you mean ¤·
the ai can consistently near one hundred of the time beam you in the face with a shitty fourzero durability trash mod ak from any distance while moving thats not good ai its not the ai outplaying us either its replacing actually engaging ai with artificial difficulty of inhuman aim and reaction speeds
what do you mean the game is meant to be realistic clearly i dont know about you but in my super classified navy seal airborne marine special forces training they tat us how to jigglepeak and bunny hop
not to mention he shot the ai first which would aimpunch players but ai doesnt suffer from that so he just loses
the rogue was already agrod from a previous peek not shown in the clip was already fixated on that spot and when the rogue pushed forward it had essentially already had the los lined up
bro at night time i was near the construction site and i have no clue how they saw me but the grenade launcher rogue obliterated me i measured it i think it was something like twothreeone metres in nighttime
yeah but you so much as pop a half chub irl and every one of them in a mile radius can threesixzero noscope you in the fucking retinas again
any time you take good quad nvgs and a sevensixtwo nato gun to lighthouse expect to be killed by a cheater
yeah i should bring in some flirs and see all what this is all about it you ahahsah wahdhf dg
got shot tro a door crack yeasterday head eyes fuck scopes iron sights for the win i guess
rogue and rouge are two different words entirely and are not exchangeable aluminum and aluminium are two different spellings both correct and interchangeable
where in any of what i said did i defend bsgs coding you completely illiterate fourzeroiq child
its irrelevant how you think the games coding should work its been this way for years and the op made an absolutely dogshit decision within the confines of how the game actually works
deserved downvote away doesnt bother me in the slightest op played like shit and died
you can think what you want about the ai and you could write a onefourzero page novella about the ways in which bsg could change it but thats all completely irrelevant
this is how the ai works this is how its always worked this is how it will continue to work op played like shit within the confines of the video game as it currently stands regardless of how you think the game should work 
if you need youtube guides to work out how to play the game that says it all try just actually playing and learning yourself instead of immediately seeking advice from others at the smallest sign of difficultychallengeuncertainty 
dying isnt a big deal in the slightest learn from the mistake and adapt
yes but the ai also doesnt have guns lol but that is the prise it should have
most modern shooters are either incredibly easy have bullet sponge enemies or rely on a streamlined trialanderror system in single player or coop that allows you to retry the encounter within a few seconds of dying
completely different than tarkov
my man good shit
i have he doesnt use any kind of real statistical analysis hes using a very small pool of anecdotal data and jumping to massive conclusions ive played four wipes my brother has kappa between me and him weve got ninezerozerozero hours we both have seen and or been killed by less than onezero blatant cheaters all wipe that doesnt mean cheaters dont exist because thats just my anecdotal experience but the idea that sixzero of games have a cheater is patently absurd
yes cheaters are out there but the ones that kill other players are almost always blatantly cheating like they fly around the map etc ive been killed by three blatant cheaters all wipe one was named banmeplzsixnine and literally was invisible and could fly the other was a guy on factory who killed me after i had ratted silently in one spot for onefive minutes and he shot me thro a wall i added him and he asked if i wanted a carry thats how blatant he was and both of them got banned my brother has ran into threefive of the blatantly cheating flying guys and he has kappa this wipe 
the rmt chinese farmers that use hacks to farm for rmt play exclusively on west for the most part and bsgs efforts to limit rmt have significantly hurt rmt
cheaters were a much bigger problem last wipe and the wipe before that there was so much rmt farming going on i know because i met cheaters thro the official discord and they usually were using it to farm rmt or farm carrys
the ai mod is called sains
sains for the ai
i just got prefired in a secluded corner in shoreline where the village isnot the sanitar onewhile afk for like onefive mins watching a video and dude storms in doesnt check any corners besides the one im in and starts shooting before i even see his shoulder come around the corner
well you seen you used your third eye and you should have made it blind
that is exactly what i was going for good job yes you did it  wait
have them not lock on for one thing you can also adjust their accuracy or time it takes to acquire target lots of things the single player mod tarkov people have many mods that mess with ai and provide a much better experience
sounds like you are lacking the ai skill
yeah i was an arctic seal its kind of like navy seals but cooler and makes funny noises we learned to take five stimulants and be drugged out all the
time rubbing lip balm on my face and bunny hopping across door ways to peak my enemies
i know why it happened 
im saying it should not happen because its dogshit gameplay
rogue ai doesnt get reduced vision as it gets darker it is binary they either have full vision or have their reduced night vision nothing in between twoonefourfive ¿¼” zerofive hundred they cannot see you at construction you just werent there at what the rogues consider night
source hundreds of nighthouse raids this wipe
i think they increased his range because i remember he didnt shoot unless you were closer to the beach last wipe but this wipe ive been killed close to the construction site by the grenade launcher
soon they wont be dont worry
gotta love a realistic tactical shooter where holding an angle against a sprinting opponent is f level play
youre full of it
what the hell is an ego peak anyway
they hated him because he was right
you mad
you probably got to level threezero and decided to become an expert
honestly you have a fair point the guide makers put in the work  without them youd have no choice but to die to oneone hundredhp laser aimbot ai again and again until you found whatever bs cheese works on them i avoid ai bosses like the plague cause i just dont think theyre fun but youre right somebody has to make those guides so that the content is more accessible
the guy just said it is how it is lmao    
ima keep it real with you chief it is completely irrelevant what you think about people complaining and giving feedback on the contrary to yours git gud the    
onefourzero page novella about the ways in which bsg could change it
is very much relevant and valuable if you didnt notice yet were all here playing closed beta and the first google search will tell you that beta tests are used to identify any remaining bugs or usability issues and gather feedback on the overall user experience so that feedback is very much needed and if its too hard for you comprehend the idea of giving feedback or say anything besides try actually playing then many people will kindly ask you to fuck right off as even the simplest ai bad pls fix complaint brings more to the table than anything you wrote so far
yeah if you need guides you should just go back and replay the tutorial
timmies will downvote but this death is deserved
no its absolutely not different literally the only thing stopping tarkov from being exactly what you described is the cranked up ai damageaim and the multiplayer format
have bullet sponge enemies or rely on a streamlined trialanderror system
this is already the case tho higher tier enemies difficulty comes entirely from arbitrarily buffed health pools and aim plus the entire pve gameplay loop is built around trial and error as you figure out how to exploit the ai
none of this makes for good ai its just bandaids and artificial difficulty
rmt is a subsection of cheaters but you have tons more people still offering carries rage cheaters and people who just cheat for the hell of it to get an advantage most people use radar but plenty of nonflying aimbotters as well
acting like the rmt changes cut cheating way down is just foolish and wrong
and literally was invisible and could fly
if he was invisible how did you know he was flying
between me and him weve got ninezerozerozero hours we both have seen and or been killed by less than onezero blatant cheaters all wipe
too many words sounds like cope
bro typed a whole essay like bro aint nobody got time to read all that shit
okay those are the blatant cheaters that are easy to detect and ban how about all of the less obvious stuff like esp and radars or how about the people who selectively use aimbot
i agree with both of you it just needs some better fine tune accuracy but a rogue should not be as easy as a scav did op say they were already engaged prior big no no if you get engaged you have to wait for them to deaggro or you will get fucked no matter what
much better but also much easier yea the fixes you speak of taking longer to acquire the target not locking on and adjusting their accuracy aka make them miss more shots these are all things that make the ai just plain easier to defeat which is not their goal and basically loot pi±atas more fun for some but not for others 
the idea like most things in tarkov is much easier said than done actually making the ai more fun to fight but not compromising their difficulty is insanely hard to accomplish same argument as fix spawns we are too close its just so much easier on paper than realistically fixing 
so youre not wrong in saying it needs fixed but youre wrong for thinking its some easy issue with simple solutions like you named much more complicated
youre absolutely correct 
i will take this advice and go about making sure i have the same capabilities as the ai 
anybody know how i can go about getting zero weapon sway zero recoil extrasensory perception so that i can track players thro tho solid objects on the other side of the map and the ability to lock my aim to specific body parts
honestly the ai should have an idea of where is at if he was already aggrod they just need to tune down their accuracy a tiny bit theirs a mod for offline that does this wonderfully but i cant remember what its called
oh it plays terribly no disputing that for the time being all we can do is cheese or flip a coin
i did see on the updated roadmap for ai improvements in the august wipe so hopefully something comes of that
yeah probably was between like oneninezerozero still dark as piss but not nighttime apparently 
ive seen people get grenade lauchered all the way at informants beachhouse absolutely ridiculous
why wont they be what is your reasoning for thinking this
your mistake was in thinking that tarkov is remotely realistic or a tactical shooter its a hardcore looter shooter filled with gameisms the only thing it has in relation to real life is the gun partsnames
ego peak is a very common term in fps games and is actually extremely self explanatory if you use your brain
guy who doesnt even know what an ego peak is tries to discuss nuances of an fps game
one hundred reddit
ikr the keyboard warrior over here lol
fucking cultists dude ive hunted bloodhounds sanitar and his guards reshala and his guards and shturman and his guards but ill be fuckin damned if i could ever kill a fucking cultist impossible pretty much to see on thermals they literally rat in the hardest to see places run fucking fast have night vision are silent and are as skilled as a rogue or bloodhound like fuck cultists dude
yeah all us who played the game for years before there even existed a wiki or guides at all just gave up and didnt play till some lord and savior streamer came and saved us
critical thinking is dead long live blind obedience
higher tier enemies difficulty comes entirely from arbitrarily buffed health pools
theyre far from being bullet sponges even a juiced up sanitar will die in one hit from a shotgun
as you figure out how to exploit the ai
but even once you figure out how to exploit it a lot of the time you have to sort of tiptoe around the encounter while doing we is required for the cheese all while other players are likely also trying to kill the boss thats what leads to some of the most intense and hilarious moments in tarkov
its not good ai but it does drive players towards the type of game situations that are seemingly exactly what bsg wants and its fun which is why we all keep coming back to the game wipe after wipe i dont think tarkov is a case either of being fun except for the darn ai i think the jankiness and ridiculous threat levels that can come from the ai adds to the game in a weird way
i agree  i think most people that cheat do it because they dont like losing
because we could see tracers flying from a spot in the sky at us following us thro the air all the way down shoreline beach
i cant read
how melted is your attention span that two paragraphs are too much for you to read fucking zoomers man
reading words is indeed difficult
who likes the way ai are right now id rather it be too easy than be like it is now you will always have players for difficulty as well 
and even then i really dont think it would be too easy im a tarkov vet and have played alot of the game got kappa etc and even with that on the single player mod i still die and it still has some challenge
not to mention everything has just been nerfed and shit on to the point of being unfun raiders dropping shit ammoshit gear shit broken guns it wouldnt be as bad if tarkov didnt have such a dumb tiered system for effectiveness like the realism mod but it does
i dunno just doesnt feel good all around
hax youre looking for hax
if were using piss as a darkness measurement perhaps a doctors visit is in order
the earliest you want to start queuing up for nighthouse is twoonethreezero but if you have a quick load and a close spawn you can still get bonked by a rogue so be careful there
i got killed there just the other day
your mistake is egocentric abuse of shared game knowledge
you miss the point of this post bad ai is still bad ai  regardless of loophole mechanics
an ego peek is putting yourself in a vulnerable situation where you know an enemy will probably be and engaging in a fivezerofivezero duel in cs im gonna ego peek mid with an awp is just busting out into the area and trying to snap onto a player and kill them as opposed to working around the map playing angles and flanks
holding an angle behind cover on an ai is in no way an ego peek in any definition of the term
yes the meaning is obvious
i just dont like the term especially when its misused
what an ego explaination lol
i love how fourtwozeroprayit and eighteightvicodin spread their immense knowledge
guy who doesnt even know what an ego peak
lol its a peek you spelled it wrong like six times an ego peak is nothing
ahh my favorite hiking spot ego peak
i can surmise what it means if thats what youre implying i just dont see the applicability here
regardless thought
op wasnt peaking or  ego peaking or whatever he was holding an angle
i dont need to be a super csgo operator to tell the difference
i reiterate my previous point
youre full of it
no an ego peek is you peeking heaven with ak when you know theres an awp there but want to try to get the kill anyways cuz he just domed two of your friends holding an angle in a tactical fps against ai is not an ego peek
bloodhounds are broken too i usually dont get killed by ai much since i cheese them and know the safe ways but last night my team spawned sunken on shoreline pushed up to go into the village to fight the goons and i saw four things on thermal i was almost twozerozerom away i believe i went prone behind a big tree and right peaked and lined up a headshot before i could shoot i was dead  ninexonenine pst  fucking pst from that far four of them to the face
im sorry life was so hard for you back in the day old timer
thanks for laying the ground work for all those guides so i didnt have to waste tons of time figuring it out myself
too many words again try harder bub
ok that makes sense
he meant dark ass piss because when you piss from your ass its usually pretty dark
regardless tho op wasnt peaking or  ego peaking or whatever he was holding an angle i dont need to be a super csgo operator to tell the difference
this is correct in every community holding an angle is never considered an ego peek or peak ego peeking would be what the ai did running out unfavourable into someone holding an angle hopping to kill quick to survive then again that isnt even a peak but a full on run out lmao
only broken in the daytime nighttime at times they get sketchy for no reason but ninezero of my experiences were eazy cheesing with a flir and medium range
thanks for being one of the guide following timmys that are just a free kill every raid because they cant do a single thing for themselves except try and emulate what they see on youtube 
also i dont remember ever saying the game was hard at all but hey you said it so it must be true my mistake i can see your reading comprehension skills are as adequate as your critical thinking ones ignorance is bliss i suppose
relax nerd
you are not a real person
i hope there are better days coming for you buddy
fear introduced the goap goal oriented action planning  ai for smarter enemies and to this day still has some of the best ai and has even been used in the most recent tomb raider games nearly fifteen years later
steam accually used a clever system in halflife two that made enemies more likly to attack you from the nearest ledge in order order for you to feel more like an action movie badass knocking people to their demise good example of smarter not being better
i know about one example oblivion what i heard is that each of the thousand npc had their own needs and wants and that was what determining their routine for the day
they ended up dumbing it down because they kept running in to problems  one story often told is that one npcs ai determined that it was time to rake the leaves only the nearest rake was in the possession of another npc  so the ai determined the easiest way to get it was to murder the npc and take it from his corpse  five minutes later the player wanders in and theres a dude raking leaves and a corpse in the corner the player wondering what the hell just happened
so they cut it down as they couldnt get the priorities working correctly such that they wouldnt murder other friendly npcs for items they needed
thats the story at least  not sure how true it is
if you want to talk about oblivion ai has day schedule that makes it look more alive and preferences in combat that makes it try to act more efficiently by default the latter isnt tuned very well but there are several ai mods that does nothing but adjust already existing parameters to make combat ai much more dangerous
i dont remember everything but heres a list of things an ai can do in unmodded oblivion and could do with some fixing pick upserior weapon switch between melee and ranged when appropriate sidestep attacks use consumable items whenever it thinks it is appropriate retreat to survive or retreat to heal look around for a player that managed to conseal themselves after combat take better equipment from corpses stay at a distance if it cant handle player in melee or not engage at all if it knows it cant win the things it cant perform are any kind of team tactics and surprise attacks
day schedule on the other hand already looks alright for the most partsome addons introduce schedule bugs for certain npcs iirc  most sleep at night work at day and relax at evening some are also set to travel to their friends on certain days of the week or month some activities are also set to change npcs clothing so say a knight wont be sleeping with their armor on or a guard wont have their torch out during the day hours
the best part about all this is that ai doesnt have to be pointed to specific things it needs to interact with or use althot it can be done when desired  npcs can find free seats in a select tavern on their own they can roam around forest freely looking for deers to hunt they can find and steal food if they must eat and are ok with breaking the law
to bring up something that isnt fear halo has some neat nuance to enemies throout the series like how if you get an elite down to low health they may aggro and pull out their sword or i think in halo two if you kill all brutes in an area except for one or was it just if you did eno damage to them the last one will go super crazy throw their weapon away and run straight for you in a fit of blind rage or how hunters will moan and attack far more aggressively when their partner is killed
and of course theres the classic grunts running away in fear after their squad leader elite is killed its all of the stuff like that that give them a lot of character heck elites and brutes can even hijack your own vehicles just like you can to them it gives off a feeling like they have the same capability as you
theres lots of other little stuff im sure im missing too like suppressive fire or the flood reanimating dead bodies in halo three a lot of this stuff was probably inspired by halflife ones ai too which is like the granddaddy of this sort of thing
no one is gonna mention alife in the stalker series they actually had to tone it down for the release 
but basically the ai would play their own choosetheirownadventure game with branching choices and these were done on a small scale on an event basis not one long storyline so npcs would interact with the world and other npcs and make choices in these events
not sure if that makes sense but what this simple system resulted in is a world were npcs played the game along with you so it all felt natural and it would organically create small subplots
you could see a group of scavengers meet some military in a base get in a fight the winners would then scavenge the bodies for loot then continue to their scavenging location only to be met by some hungry mutant dogs there that were looking for food they had to tone it down because some npcs might finish the storyline before the player did
edit dwarf fortress is also a good one
thats really hard to say good ais in games are not good ais but an ai made to look good
usually when players say an ai is good and then you hear the devs talk about it its just some clever scripts  stuff like that
you could potentially make a super advanced ai that kinda thinks like an human etc but in the end its way easier to make something specific usually for better results too and of course you cant just train an ai to be good because itll be too good in the end is more a question of balancing than making a good ai so definitely not something limited by the technology
stealth game are often criticized for their dumb ais for example but its not because good ai would be hard to make but because the game simple wouldnt be fun without rules and limitations to the ais capacities and yeah im sure players dont even notice the most advanced ais
check out this talk i think it gives a good overview of the idea of ais in games  
as for me i really like systemic games so any ai made to work that way is cool to me like enemies picking up whats around them to fight with stuff like that
sims is the obvious example here they have complex behaviour patterns but then again the whole games premise is based around it
blackwhite comes to mind you can teach your creature and your subjects and they all also spontaneously learn stuff
the fable series yes another lionhead game tried to implement an advanced ai to all the random npcs their preferences etc but it was a bit too simplistic in the end the end result wasnt in my opinion as nice as something youd see in gothic where npcs have set daily routines which is normal nowadays
fears and halflife combat ai is excellent
cant think of anything else noteworthy this vexes me
oblivions npcs didnt have ai they had unique scripts the actual ai was dumb as shit
fear is a game which accidentally had good ai thanks to a small programming bug which made enemies very likely to flank you and otherwise engage with you im not sure it counts if its an accident but in fear a lot of the enemy behavior is completely unscripted
metal gear solid as a series generally has some pretty good ai on the higher difficulty settings mgstwothree are especially notable for how good they are given the constraints of putting the ai into a pstwo game
the problem with ai is not that we cant make good ai its that making a good ai generally makes for a very unfun game enemies are obstacles for the player to overcome and an enemy which is smarter and more aware than the youngdrunkhightired player at the end of their day is not a fun obstacle its an annoying one
the thing about an ai thats smarter than a player is its pretty much indistinguishable from cheating
what players really seem to want is predictable ai so they can feel smart for being better than it they want to know what the ai is thinking this is what fear did so well good communication with the player and a play area designed to exploit it pretty much all stealth games have a way to tell the player theyve been spotted or are about to be spotted as another example
the most recent example that i think wowd me are the imps from doom twozeroonesix  specifically the ones that are tasked to run away and hide from the player and use ranged attacks  i know its just a trick but its a really good trick
also after listening to the ai design in the noclip documentary i thot the token system was a clever idea  basically all the enemies share regenerating attack tokens which must be spent to attack the player  in this way the rate of attack can be controlled and so the player isnt just overwhelmed  and the enemies have their own little token marketplace in which they can trade tokens with one another to create more sensible and dramatic attack scenarios for the player
the thing about good ai is that it is totally reliant on player perception so ai doesnt have to actually be smart or dynamic it just has to appear that way it also needs to be fun
im not aware of any game that doesnt have the classic oh i just saw a guy get shot in the face right beside me with an arrow oh ten seconds have passed i am now no longer worried about this dead man let me stand right next to where he died
but think about how annoying it would be if ai were actually vigilant like a soldier in real life or were actually perceptive like a human being youd be hardpressed to do anything stealthily
fear ai is always brot up because they made the enemies appear to be extremely smart but in reality its a bunch of if this then that logic that is accompanied by the soldiers shouting and good level design based around their ai
like you mentioned npcs having daily routines rarely if ever is noticed by the player or affects them in a meaningful way the type of ai you need is completely related to the type of game youre making
an ai that had actual military tactical techniques and good aim would more than likely be overwhelming and unfun for the player
tbh i cant even think of the last time i was actually impressed with the ai in a game
you should check out 
elizabeth from bioshock infinite for a compelling companion npc  the ai is an integral part of why shes a beloved game character
the ai of alien isolation for an example of opponent ai this game cheats but does it in a way that keeps you entertained
many people dont realize just how good this is but fifas ai does a great job at moving the players that are not in direct control of a human over the years this stopped being a significant problem and plays lookfeel more natural because of the improvements in how the ai understands plays in order to position players that are not on the ball  its the kind of improvement that goes unnoticed because its so subtle but good eno not to break imersion anymore
i think this discussion should cover strategy games more than rpgs shooters action games the biggest improvements would have to be related to starcraft two and it shows true evolution unlike most other games first theres the games ai that allows the player to go against basic version of strategies they might encounter online the ability to practice against this with the ai is basically unprecedented in other games the ai is not that good overall its better than in any strategy game but it has its obvious limitations  hey it still has to run on the same machine that has to run the game smoothly for the player too not an easy task and the game is complex eno to cover properly its very impressive what theyve achieved 
and then theres alphastar look if youre really interested about the topic you have to read or watch videos about what the deepmind team did we basically have an ai that can beat professional players in starcraft two this is relevant as it explains to you why it was so difficult to advance as fast as it was expected twozero years ago but it also shows that we now have the technology to create ais that can execute top level tasks at the same level as a human can and while the training of that ai might require a large number of machines the binary that you need for your playthros are not too demanding for a single machine to handle im definitely seeing some interesting development because of what the alphastar team achieved
i thot the ai in doom twozeroonesix was goodi saw some video on ­t and it seemed really clever but ive never really payed attention to game design while playing
they movement in rage is great not sure if that counts
tropicos citizens are pretty complex with likesdislikes specific jobs specific homes relationships and allegiances
this is hearsay from when i worked at ubisoft the bad guys in i think it was rainbow six vegas has very complex humanlike behavior ais however once it was published the players just saw oh a guy is over there shoot him and they decided it wasnt worth investing in
persona three that game didnt let you manually control your party members but the ai was pretty good and never fucked up to the point where i died if i died it was because of my own mistake or that my levelsequipmentpersona was too bad
a lot of the problems with modern games are that they are serverbased which means even if theyre not fullyfledged mmos theyre still bound by the technical limitations of the servers
and we already know that advanced ai calculations are expensive if we also now have a serverbased game like the division destiny anthem or any of its ilk then you end up with similar ai limitations as mmos
so essentially because more and more devs decide to go serverbased we end up moving a little bit backwards in terms of aiadvancement and technology
that said itll be interesting to see what cloudgamingstreaming will bring to the mix if we can add everybodys computational power together somehow it might be interesting to see what the future brings 
i remember at the time it came out far cry the first one was known for its clever ai i found a nice video about it wwwyoutubecomwatchvninethreebptrlkniywwwyoutubecomwatchvninethreebptrlkniy
at the time all of these things features were really impressive
i think the best ai would be ai from cs onesix 
but again it greatly depends on the map for example if the map is dust two and the creators of the map are really skilled the bots are really good
 steam accually used a clever system in halflife two that made enemies more likly to attack you from the nearest ledge in order order for you to feel more like an action movie badass knocking people to their demise
and thus dark messiah of might  magic
theres a paper written in twozerozerosix about fear ia httpalumnimediamitedusevenejorkingdctwozerozerosixorkinjefffearpdf
its not the first time i hear about fear as an example its true that their ai seemed very good
except for the fact that they keep screaming their position and what theyre going to do to the player
its a joke i know it was done to make the game more fun but still it has always bugged me
valve
one of my favourite things in oblivion is that the guards had ninefive aggression on a scale of oneone hundred but one hundred responsibility they were basically all extremely disciplined psycho murderers and the way they behaved in game reflected it perfectly
i love that story i hope its true
theres also another story of the devs finding the corpse of a prisoner that was not supposed to be dead in an open cell they were trying to fix it when they noticed the prisoner was always murdered by the guards it turns out once the guards run out of food they kill this poor fucker for his
constantly impressed at how well that alien worked in that game
they also gave the alien some light learning capabilities or at least the illusion of such overusing the flamethrower could cause it to start to charge thro the flames it might pay less attention to noisemakers etc
til
i loved the variability in halos enemiesai thats probably why i was able to play the campaigns so much before i had xbl i know nothing about how advanced the ai actually was but the devs did a great job at creating dynamic and reactive encounters
enemies in stalker would even sneak behind you while you are busy fighting their friends
they also looted bodies helped their allies after combat would hide in nonsolid obstacles like bushes
zombies in cop wouldnt attack you if you were just walking near them but jogging default movement would alert them
the crazy flankingcqc manoeuvres those npcs would pull off is just astounding
there was a discussion on this sub a while ago about guards and how they react in stealth game i think it would be indeed a mistake to make them too smart but on the other hand i think it would be more interesting to randomize their reaction for instance showing fear when the player has already dispatched all the other guards or pretending to not see you because hes not paid eno for this shit and react to different stimuli for instance if you cleared a level almost completely the last guard would notice it
it would encourage the player to use alternate solution instead of always using the same old method isolating and dispatching
god i wish someone would try a game in the vein of black and white again raising your creature was such a unique and fun experience i had a lion that was just a sweetheart in the town but outside of the walls he would fuck anybody up
my friends discovered that if you punished your creature constantlyarbitrarily it would eventually become neurotic and too scared to do anything in hindsight its a little depressing how realistic that is
the thing about an ai thats smarter than a player is its pretty much indistinguishable from cheating
only if cleverness actually determines who wins most video games are very asymmetric so that doesnt have to be the case eg no matter how genius a small squad of grunts in halo get master chief has such an overwhelming advantage in stats that a good human player will be able to defeat them
and besides why are you even talking about beating the player as a designer you decide what your ais goals are if you think outside the box a bit you can easily give ai a different optimization target than winning really hard eg the ai in left four dead
then finally even if the computer is playing the same game as the human and they are trying to win even then it can be a great experience i have the most fun in competitive games when im playing against an opponent who does some things better than me and some things worse than me and i can learn from them or try to leverage where im better to defeat them you could make an ai target this experience
a stupid ai that makes horrible decisions but just gets a lot of bonuses and therefore is moderately competitive vs me will never teach me anything and also quickly stops being fun to play against
not really cheating is seeing player moves thro fog of war or getting bonuses etc ai that can win without having an edge over the player is good ai
the thing about an ai thats smarter than a player is its pretty much indistinguishable from cheating
this gets trotted out every time this discussion comes up but i never see any evidence for the claim what games had ai that was so smart that everyone thinks its cheating
that was from horizon zero dawn right probably one of the bestfeeling combat systems out there imo im excited to see what the death stranding team is doing with that engine
dwarf fortress has astonishingly complex ai under the hood as its half game half simulation the whole game is in itself one big giant ai composed of countless tiny threads of individual ais
even just playing the game you dont really get a sense of it but even a single dwarf has an incredibly convoluted linearity of personal inclinations defined by their past trauma and experiences
im curious but do you have any background in dev or game dev in particular
but they have aimbots and wall hacks
you bastard now i have to play it again
also known as sir kicksalot deathboot and the conveniently placed spiked wall
you know everyone talks about the ledge kicking in that game but my favorite thing is easily smashing chairs over peoples headsand rocksand barrels and throwing the occasional cup just for las
a big part of the reason guardsenemies are so vocal is so players know whats going on 
if theyre smart and flank you while being silent players just feel like it was an unfair ambush or maybe it was just random bad luck if an enemy yells im gonna flank and they get to see them moving around or they can choose to counter the flanker they appreciate whats going on and what the ai thot process is
then theres the question of if the player actually knows the difference between that all being scripted perencounter or if the ai recognizes locations and routes in a level and thinks about using a side route while player attention is elsewhere when not to just attack a lot of games are smoke and mirrors and it might be a better use of time to disguise the scripted approach 
 except for the fact that they keep screaming their position and what theyre going to do to the player
its so the player realizing what theyre doing and doesnt think the ai is just a cheating bastard which is what playtesters were saying before they added in the barks
interesting to see that almost all the people answering to your thread talk about combat
what about npcs there are no smart or interesting npcs in video games
i believe the industry does not know how to do smart ai non combat
maybe you should play csgo
imagine if it happened in real life
l think it would be indeed a mistake to make them too smart but on the other hand i think it would be more interesting to randomize their reaction for instance showing fear when the player has already dispatched all the other guards or pretending to not see you because hes not paid eno for this shit and react to different stimuli for instance if you cleared a level almost completely the last guard would notice it
if i recall correctly the arkham games do this already the last guard or few guards get really nervous and start frantically looking for you especially if instead of taking down the henchman you hang them upsidedown that increases their unease
too much randomization is actually not that great of an idea for ai in stealth games
as with any game there need to be patterns that the player can learn to recognize and exploit in order to become better obviously a small degree of randomness is important to have and there is nothing wrong with guards that have complex behavior but that behavior needs to be consistent and predictable this allows the player to devise strategies and techniques
when a player fails at an encounter or a task in a game they need to be able deduce why exactly they failed so they can attempt to correct that error on subsequent attempts to many random guard behaviors such as a guard randomly deciding that he isnt compensated eno to pursue you will leave the player confused as to wether their success was a fluke when that guard decides to chase them on subsequent attempts
black and white two was my jam
there is a nuance  
script generally means it will do a predetermine sequence of actions  
where as many means by ai something that will determine the sequence of actions to take
thats not how an ai works
ai makes a spontaneous decision based on the events around them which is the exact opposite of performing predetermined tasks on a schedule unless interrupted
to use the infamous cheating npc example
in oblivion the npc will cheat on his wife like clockwork unless the player interferes there is no ai decision being made hes just following a predetermined set of tasks if it were an ai making this decision the npc would be cheating whenever his wife npc was away at varied times based on the wife npc actions and the availability of the mistress npc it would be spontaneous not predetermined
think of it like the difference between an enemys actions in metal gear solid before and after interacting with the guards before you interact with them they will follow a set patrol route no ai there however if snake taps on a wall or gets cat their actions are now dependent on what is happening and what they can do in response that part is ai
well i wouldnt say its cheating but i dont agree with you either
good ai in my opinion can be broken down into two categories
one  technically good ai  this is the ai that can win without getting an edge  this is actually incredibly easy to create and implement but will be viewed by most people as terrible ai  why  because your average person is stupid  like really really stupid  the ai will flank work as a team etc and dominate the player  just play any first person shooter to verify this  youll see people making tons of dumb mistakes that should always be avoided and then theyll be complaining about the other team cheating when the fault really resides on their end
two ai thats just slightly worse than the player  now this is incredibly difficult to program  this is what most people want  they want to be able to win with feeling like they just squeaked out a victory  first tho this type of ai can be exploited  ie need for speed was notorious for having rubber banding ai  on multiple occasions people noticed that theyd lose if they drove practically flawlessly but would win if they acted like idiots the first portion of the race and then drove flawlessly  how can an ai adjust to this  second how do you just how good a player is just to be slightly worse
offhand i know fft calculators are so amazingly smart that for crystal calc sccs the general advice is to put the game on autobattle
exactly why i love the rock it launcher and junk jet in fallout
tvtropesorgpmwikipmwikiphpmainthecomputerisacheatingbastard
dont thank me guys
they do but its a pointless waste of resources
nineninenine of players wont appreciate the difference between a smart noncombat ai and a dumb one hell even smart combat ais routinely get dumbed down because it turns out that fighting enemies smarter than you when they also outnumber you is a bad time
yes and they will also adapt to the tactics you use keep swinging from gargoyles theyll destroy them or booby trap them you keep using vents to get them theyll blow them up with a grenade they will lay down mines and turrets and stuff to hinder your mobility its awesome
true i wasnt thinking about this example specifically but thats a good point
will leave the player confused as to wether their success was a fluke when that guard decides to chase them on subsequent attempts
but theres also the problem of a player that becomes to good at the game they end up having no challenge because patterns become predictable
exactly what i was about to point out
ai isnt making up any new actions ai in every game is working from a predetermined sequence of actions at a very basic level its a series of ifthen statements aka a script
the difference is the schedule
the actions are still predetermined  the enemies didnt come up with their action on the spot they react to one of several predetermined stimuli with one of several different predetermined actions
ai in games is a lot less spontaneous than youre making it out to be
 unless the player interferes 
at which point the behavior changes
npc behavior in every single game will remain unchanged absent player intervention
i ask because i was wondering where you got the idea about studios have to make a choice between keeping up with current graphics trends and having very good ai
i dont think its down to limited processing power id probably put it more down to the amount of time devs have to actually develop satisfying ai modern gaming consoles  pcs have such an overabundance of memory and processing power that it doesnt tend to be the limiting factor any more
i dont think so
populate the gta world with an ai that can have a meaningful conversation with me that tells me about the day that goes buy an umbrella when it rains make friends etc
then we ll see ok thanks its been a few years since i played an arkham game i had forgotten about that
that is why you want multiple enemy types that exhibit a variety of behaviors rather than enemies that are merely random
new enemy types can be introduced over time and those enemies can be arranged in new configurations in order to match the players learning curve
yep a script can be a full ai but generally speaking when we talk about ai we talk about the architecturealgorithm that use those ifelse because by your definition every software ever created is a script and an ai thus that definition is not that useful
im an ai programmer 
this is just completely wrong alphago for example is playing games that no one has ever seen or thot of before because of the massive action space of go and even plays moves that human experts consider to be innovative by what stretch of the imagination is this a predetermined sequence of actions
the only thing you were right about is that a scripted sequence can indeed be a form of ai
 the actions are still predetermined the enemies didnt come up with their action on the spot they react to one of several predetermined stimuli with one of several different predetermined actions 
 ai in games is a lot less spontaneous than youre making it out to be
which is how people react to stimuli if youre a guard in a facility and you come across footsteps you investigate because thats your job if you come across an intruder you attempt to deal with them if they react with force you react in kind or maybe youll flee if youre wounded depending on the area youre in you might use a skid with boxes on it for concealment if youre attacked so its harder for your attacker to accurately shoot at you or retreat to a doorway thro a brick wall for cover so that the bricks can soak up the gunfire
ai in games is a lot better at mimicking a human response than youre pretending if its done right several games do so being deliberately obtuse are we
it also stands out to me that the people making graphics are going to be a different discipline to the ai team seriously look at the credits for any modern game and its a huge amount of people involved its not the ninezeros when you might be lucky to have a dozen people
and definitely agreed about overabundance of processing power people have been saying the consoles or toaster low spec pcs are holding things like ai back but the some of the common examples of impressive ai are all well over a decade old and even the most modest modern hardware will play them without a problem
ai seems more like a designimplementation problem fitting it into the gameplay than it does a processing power problem
populate the gta world with an ai that can have a meaningful conversation with me that tells me about the day that goes buy an umbrella when it rains make friends etc
thats a lot of work for what is basically going to wind up as a gimmick
maybe zeroone or even less of the players who play gtav would bother to actually engage with random npcs eno that that level of depth of ai is necessary and it sure as shit would cost more than zeroone of the games budget to do so in a meaningful way
it is technically possible off the top of my head i can think of at least two or three broadlevel approaches to creating such a system which would allow you to pick a random npc get their phone number
ingame and then integrate them into the cast like an actually fleshedout character that was meant to be there in the first place it would be simple to implement but very costly in terms of development time and resources
however the fact that its possible doesnt make the development of such ai practical or feasible for a video games purpose
well id be interested to see what you dig up i studied comp sci at uni so have a fairly good idea of how development goes  but know not much knowledge specifically around game dev
well well thats pretty interesting kind of a shame that the ai devs get the shaft like that but i guess also not that surprising people are like crows we like shiny things 
also had no idea about a dedicated ai chip even being a possibility but its certainly a cool one
it doesnt matter if you gonna make game you gonna make it
this is why indie games with retro graphics or even text adventure game still existed they dont care to move to threed photorealistic at all 
same as ai they dont have to use it to make a game they just make game their way it also apply to engine choice as well even today someone still make their own engine in order to make game
ill add a counter argument there has never been a better time to be in games theres things generative ai brings to the table that solve long standing gaps in gaming the next onezero years are going to see an explosion of creativity and exploration of games gaming technologies thats unprecedented
think of how hollow and brittle current games are with npcs with simulation of world events games also have a content problem where we cant scale good content to match the desires of gamers theres an endless list of ways in which ai can aid us current focus on gpt as a chatbot is not looking deep eno
now selling games is an entirely different matter but as someone who is excited about seeing the art of games advance this is going to be fire
also consider checking out my subreddit raigamedev
the recent advances in ai that youre talking about dont really exist outside of niche applications there are some notable exceptions but otherwise the field has been stagnant for decades
what people think is advancement is merely using bigger and bigger datasets chatgpt is a prime example of this they used enormous amounts of training data to get it to be even somewhat useful
heres the thing about training data very few have access to it and its ultra expensive to acquire and work with it unless you steal it of course its mostly useless to small budget companies for basing complex products on
the age of ai is not here yet until we have ai models that can be trained using the data generated by a very small number of people say below one hundred i wouldnt discount the importance of traditional development just yet ai was a popular topic at gdc this year several platforms are integrating chatgpt or similar services which can already generate code there are others looking at twod to threed generation procedural generation and other automation large studios like epic are making investments in this area so i expect fairly rapid adoption over the next few years check out the state of unreal
the onenineeightzeros
probably the late onenineeightzeros and early onenineninezeros  
yes ai is improving substantially  but its been around for fivezero years  perhaps you want to rephrase your question to games using the next generation of ai probably never the current nueral netmachine learning has massive problems both in being part of the production flow and lots of legal problems including copyright
never ai as it stands now machine learning modelsneural nets generating content and stuff is already a legislative hell and the prospect of using it in commercial products is unlikely at a large scale
right now its in boom aka some major advancements that interest the general public which is why its making the waves right now but it will settle out and the general public will lose interest and it will just because an aspect of everything it will continue to improve and get better but it will never replace creators sure you will see assholes like ubisoft try and eek out junior positions with their script writer ai tools and stuff but look at all the backlash that got already companies will always try to save money but at the end of the day creators dont have to let it control the industry
you dont personally have to use any ai tools or whatever and you dont have to let it discourage you either do what you need to and take the time you need to consider your options but you should never stop creating what you want to create just because of things like this it was just the other day that everyone wanted to make nft  blockchain game and we see how well that went
if youre worried about ai in general theres no industry you can hide in even physical trades will be affected by rapidly advancing robotics
the best way to protect yourself from ai is to master wielding it
that doesnt mean losing your creativity or your own bespoke craftsmanship ai is just a tool
dont be like a handpainter lamenting the invention of photoshop and the death or their artistry
the world will always change and you have to adapt to remain a part of its culture and industry
meh i remember when high level languages that compiled to machine code were considered to be the death knell of real programmers or when people complained that nobody was learning vanilla js anymore
ai is just another abstraction that further removes the dev from the machine you can choose to use it or not
ai wont replace solo game developers jobs for several reasons even tho ai has made significant advancements in recent years here are some key reasons why solo game developers will continue to be relevant
creativity and originality ai can generate content based on patterns and data it has been trained on but it still lacks the ability to create truly original and innovative concepts solo game developers can come up with unique ideas characters and storylines that ai might struggle to create
emotional intelligence human game developers have a deep understanding of human emotions and can create experiences that evoke emotional responses from players ai on the other hand lacks the emotional intelligence to create nuanced experiences that resonate with players on a deeper level
complex decisionmaking game development often involves making complex decisions based on multiple factors such as design budget and player feedback ai might be able to assist with some aspects of decisionmaking but it is not yet capable of understanding and balancing all the factors that go into game development
artistic vision solo game developers often have a strong artistic vision for their games which helps them create unique experiences aigenerated content while impressive can sometimes lack the personal touch and distinctiveness that comes from an individuals artistic vision
collaboration and communication game development often requires collaboration and communication with others such as artists musicians and writers solo game developers are skilled at working with others to bring their ideas to life while ai still struggles with understanding and responding to human communication in a meaningful way
adaptability game developers need to adapt to new technologies trends and player expectations while ai can be trained to adapt to some extent human developers can more easily adjust their approach based on the everchanging landscape of the gaming industry
in summary ai has the potential to assist solo game developers in various aspects of game development but it is unlikely to replace their jobs entirely human game developers possess unique skills creativity and emotional intelligence that are difficult to replicate with ai allowing them to create experiences that resonate with players on a deeper level
chatgpts answer ai will at best be able to make super simple games in our lifetime theres a huge difference between generating a script and a whole game
people still spend their time and money on candy crush
ai isnt going to steal anybodys candies
just because you can build starcraft three in five minutes of prompting doesnt mean youre going to have a good game and no ai wont be building starcraft three
to your question of how long unfortunately the answer for indie devssmall studios is last month
before the end of this year we will have fully ai generated scripts shortform movies and soundtracks with ai actors and voices in fact we should have this by summer
every knowledgebased industry will change over the next few months especially gaming with a projected threeninesix billion in gaming revenue for twozerotwothree
if you arent starting to incorporate ai into your tool set you will be left far far behind
twod  threed texture map graphical assets can be currently generated  ai generate pixel art is already in play ai generated audio music speech exists ai generated content that caters to individual players
so much more
the nextcurrent level of chat bots that will take absolutely takeover all social media with unfuckingprecedented coherency and mind blowing conversational skills this means you can stuff all your social media with bots that are all but indistinguishable from humans right now if its not clear that translates to a marketing team that costs pennies to operate twofourseven
all the pieces exist and are falling very neatly in place as we type
should you go into carpentry if you dont already make a good living making games and you are choosing to ignore ai in your tool set then yes go into carpentry 
or focus on btwob application development  you will not catch up without ai
is this post generated as a generic reply to some other post
doesnt address anything i said at all is there really need for such pedantics with current events i think it is fairly clear what i am referring to
lots of legal problems including copyright
the only people that think this are people that dont actually understand copyright law
the only major open question is can the works produced by ai be copyrighted and the answer seems to be only if a human also had significant involvement so thats a pretty big gray area  this is a question that will be answered in the next few years
legal problems including copyright
the only problems are about dataset distribution laionfiveb might be invalid if deemed not sufficiently transformative unlike google books
also this is a to the absolutet a technological war issue no sane court is going to rule against training material consumption and would only ever rule about distribution ruling against the use of copywritten training material means giving unilateral victory to other parties china will just do its thing and own everyone by giving zero shits
ai is a war and infrastructure power issue at the lowest
probably never
funniest shit ive ever read
here you go
dont hide your head in the sand the legal problems are massively over blown the legal issues will settle out the way they always settle outin favour of those who lobby best which means that if big content producers want generative assets copyrightablethey will end up copyrightable
i dont understand why people say never
give me a reason why this is not a counterpoint to your argument then
ai has the potential to replace many jobs including those of solo game developers for several reasons
improved efficiency ai can perform tasks faster and more accurately than humans which means that the development of games can be streamlined as ai technology advances it can automate many aspects of game development such as coding designing and testing freeing up time for developers to focus on other aspects of the project or even making their jobs obsolete
costeffectiveness employing ai can be more costeffective than hiring human developers as ai doesnt require benefits vacations or a salary this economic advantage may lead game development companies to invest in ai technology to reduce costs which could lead to a reduced demand for solo game developers
advanced tools aidriven tools are becoming more sophisticated and capable of generating complex assets such as threed models textures animations and even procedural level design these tools can greatly reduce the workload of a solo game developer and in some cases replace the need for their expertise altogether
dural content generation ai can generate game content procedurally creating endless variations of levels characters and narratives this technology can potentially replace solo game developers as it can create game worlds and stories that would take a human developer significantly more time to create
onalized gaming experiences ai can analyze player behavior and preferences tailoring game experiences to individual players this level of personalization can be hard for solo game developers to achieve as it requires a deep understanding of user data and the ability to adapt the game in realtime based on this information  
ever it is essential to note that while ai can replace certain tasks and aspects of a solo game developers job it may not be able to fully replace human creativity intuition and the unique perspective that a solo game developer brings to their work as ai technology advances it is more likely that it will complement and augment the work of game developers rather than fully replace them
further chatgpts answer
last month games that are using ai got released substantially
can you name some so i can take a look
their point is if you want to keep doing things the way youre choosing to do them then as a solo dev you have that prerogative  if you dont want to be an ai prompter  editor or whatever then just dont use those tools  but also dont be afraid of new tools
that said youre thinking way too far ahead  ai creating any meaningful game requires having eno understanding of interconnecting complex mechanics and knowing what makes something fun  this level of ai is decades away if its even possible at all
idthree and knns have been used for ages
theyre still learning models that benefit from adversarial training
killer instinct literally has you train a knn dataset with the whole shadow system
theres more than just deep useless learning out there
idk why others downvoted you here i hate people who talk like that pedantic nonsense
no aaa is going to risk having their assets unprotected by copyright it is a huge grey area and publishers do not roll dice with their ip
nice anecdotal evidence you got there
i saw you already posted this and would probably say something
to me this is just part of the boom period of all this just like nftblockchain stuff the last few years they basically say their boss doesnt care about the product and just wants to make money and save time yeah thats gonna happen and its to be expected but i wouldnt expect it on a large scale you will see it happen sure but its not gonna consume everything and take over in my opinion
im sorry if it gets you down and i hope you can still find passion and joy in creating and making things
my personal human opinion it is a great tool for solo developers like us it helps me a lot and will save me money
unless you are a concept artist or a translator your job are alright in the next couple of years
right now no one or no studio is going to admit to using ai assetsassistance since the both the massive negative public opinion and the murky legality are huge issues during the last month a bunch of ai projects really took off stable diffusion and chatgpt being some of the most talked about
heres a glimpse of what is publicly available on right now
mubert
stable diffusion
nvidia nerf
llama llm
copilot
youll see very quickly how much ai is affecting all facets of game dev
threefour years away
i disagree
luddites should just get out
i do think its very likely that its going to come down on the side of the things ai makes will be copyrighted
exactly
indie games will be flooded with ai generated stuff
either way steam was already flooded with asset flips
indies never stood a chance
gamedevs mindbroken are really an amazing sight
so ridiculous
so many people who cannot answer a question
my previous statement is more about threed games than any game  given that the idea of video game is an extremely broad concept with an even wider breadth of quality and content can you say which game or genre that exists today you think ai might be able to replicate in threefour years time
personally i actually wouldnt be surprised if ai is capable of reaching a rudimentary twod metroidvania style game by then  of course how fun that game is game design and how well it flows level design i think would still be significantly lacking in that time
but meaningful threed games with complex overlapping mechanics  not gonna happen any time soon
based
tho who knows for sure i guess wwwreuterscomlegalaicreatedimagesloseuscopyrightstestnewtechnologytwozerotwothreezerotwotwotwo
good luck out there brother
ai is threefour years away from being capable of making any game of any genre with eno rigorous detailed input you will not be able to tell it to make a game just like skyrim in threefour years but im confident that you will be able to sit down with it and extract ninenine of what is necessary to make a game like skyrim in that time
welp only time will tell
might be rather scientific but these just published a paper on a deep learning based ai for doom
something like that is currently in development 
i have no clue how they do this and im not affiliated in any way with the developers
from what ive read ai is usually discouraged in games the players like to kill dumb and predictable enemies therefore the swarm of zombiethemed games but id love to see a game where ai is something to distinguish it from the crowd aside from go and chess ai 
this might be an interesting readhttpwwwkbstwitudelftnldocsmsctwozerozeroonewaverenjeanpaulvanthesispdf for you
this vid goes into the history of bots and shows the ingenious ways the old quake and unreal devs programmed their ai
basically ai had to act as much like an actual human as possible because most people didnt have fast internet connection
nn is a solution to a fuzzy problem where information is incomplete but training examples are more abundant  for example you could use nn to improve the aim of a particularly bad shooter to make a fps more fun for a weaker player you could use a nn to manage a sidekick that tries to fill in for your weaknesses or one that gets weaker as you get stronger or finds ammo for you based on your typical firing rate   as others said its not great for opponents except in strategy games as they can get better than you fast but it might be a great solution to reduce frustration if levels are crazy difficult  for most game scenarios ais are typically more procedural and theres no reason to put a nn on it because a variable with a percentage is usually good eno creatures old game had some rudimentary ai learning capability if i recall
if im understanding the second half of your post correctly i think you should read to get a better understanding of ai in general before applying it to games good luck
virtual fighter on saturn had a learning ai  
the intent was that the ais improvements would be used gradually more frequently as the difficulty setting progressed from the first fight to the final boss
except it was too good at learning player habits to the point it would anticipate everything you could do  
it eventually was changed so you can reset the ais learned behaviours
httpleftfourdeadwikiacomwikithedirector
once i tried to implement neural network for mobs in minecraft but it was damn difficult for me to understand how nn works with the experience i get in programming and especially game programming lately i consider to implement such mechanism in my current game it would be amazing to see what mobs would do based on history of action in openworld game i wish someone would do this 
i think this is what youre looking for wwwyoutubecomwatchvifiveonexsixeightgqka
i remember seeing this on kickstarter quite a while ago and was very sad when it didnt get funded looks like a fun concept altho i doubt it will be a truly self learning ai it will probably just be programmed to react in certain ways depending on what the player does and thats it it wont really learn on how the player is playing altho thats just my own theory and i may be one hundred wrong so take what im saying with a grain of salt
ai is usually discouraged in games
exactly this
most players like to be superior only a handful like a challenge and when they take on a challenge they like to find ways how to game it
if this is true that is awful i long for the old school days of quake and unreal with actually challenging bots
im studying applied computer science so ive already been working with neural networks for years im pretty sure youd need the computational power of google to even try and run the ai of a game like minecraft with neural networks  
there are so so so many inputs and unforeseeable stuff that pretty much presents a lot of edge cases that in my opinion its just not worth it  
that being said i think if the entire game is built on the very idea to have selflearning ai it might just work thats why im trying to gather what has been done before
i only remember playing these games multiplayer how were the bots in terms of ai
i think people are okay with difficulty and challenge but not with ai that adaptsevolves to the players actions humans are not equipped for that and certainly would not find enjoyment from it the enjoyable part about challenge is overcoming ai that is constantly adapting to the player takes away that part
humans are not equipped for that and certainly would not find enjoyment from it
neither of those are true but matter of opinion depending on the player 
i for one love it i played the new unreal recently and it was awesome that i couldnt tell who was ai and who was human for a long while
the real reason we rarely see adaptive ai anymore is because of costs now we can simply play online with other actual humans for a challenge so theres no need to develop such a complex system
to answer your first question the rudimentary system was that the ai basically recorded your movements and recombined them into new patterns you jump a lot so does the ai you duck around corners to lure them into the open so does the ai you pull off a crazy meta map trick the ai now can do the same 
hmm yes looking back on my argument it was arrogant to assume people wouldnt enjoy it it certainly is up to the individual player
but at the same time i think if the market for it was adequately large it would have been done there are plenty of single player genres that could benefit from adaptive ai for a more immersive experience horror actionadventurerpgidontknowwhattocallthisbeastanymore etc
fear while its quite old the enemy ai still holds up as they employ smart flank and rush tactics to flush you out of cover
i am thinking rain world just because ai ecosystem is out of this world also am thinking starsector coz fvck them ai ships
alien isolation
the whole game is a survival horror masterpiece that fucking xenomorph has such an ai that has been praised for years and other devs have tried to replicate it without success
heres a video example bit of spoilers ahead just in case
revisiting the ai of alien fear
the last of us part ii  
alien isolation  
dishonored two
metal gear solid five
the enemies in metal gear solid v
last of us two probably has the best ive ever seen enemies hunt you down like real people 
alien isolation as well the xenomorph has jump scared me so many times
alien isolation has probably the smartes ai the alien chnages tactics it catches on to your tricks for example a noise maker device used for distracting the alien to a distant location works in the early game but as the game goes on it ignores the noise maker and if you keep using it the aluen starts to run in the opposite direction on the noise maker which is where the player would be clever girl
rain world people dedicate hours in it just to observe the ai 
some games with great enemy ai
metalgearsolid five
generation zero
sniper elite five
ghost recon wildlands
in all three the enemy ai communicate will spread out flank use cover use sound in addition to los to locate you snipe from great distance use mortars grenades rockets and melee weapons run away when attacked if they dont have a fix on you location and have somewhat randomized patrol routes and spawn locations
all four are single player with the option for cooop play
ive heard alien isolation has good ai if you like horror
stalker enemies will suppress your last known position fall back and try to flank you the mutants hunt in unique ways and they can been seen hunting eachother and other stalkers ai stalkers live out their own lives in the zone outside of your influence great ai
i didnt play the halo series but my friend did and he wont stop talking about that exactly how the singleplayer enemies would be smart to react appropriately to what you do
mount and blade the ai isnt super smart but it will keep troops in formation flank with cavalry hold strategic positions and utilise siege weaponry as for having teammates its your army versus theirs youre commanding your own troops and fighting alongside them and once you have companions you can make them command your troops instead
stalker is what you need the ai is pretty good at flanking around and taking you out especially at max difficulty where both of you are able to take each other out with one or two bullets
good ole chess
when i hear smart ai the first two games i think of are alien isolation  black  white two black and white is an rts game tho and i dont think you can even obtain a legal copy of it anymore or run it on anything modern   
some sandbox games have some pretty impressive ai but less so for their combat ai like red dead two grand theft auto five and modded skyrim hell even vanilla skyrim has the npcs living their own lives which is pretty cool
holy shit op i need you to see this its perfect for you lol 
play will you snail
the ai is genius and tries to predict your movements it also mocks you when you fail all around fantastic experience and the ai is super smart
rainworld any other answer is wrong
ground branch has some of the most realistic ai known to video game history its a coop shooter where the objective is to take out terrorist in a wide verity of maps the ai is super smart and depending on the difficulty will act like real people every step you make they can hear even from long distances which is very realistic i find this one of the best realistic shooter games just because of the ai by the way if you intend on getting this game check the hardware requirements first and update your graphics driver before playing
the enemy ai in the forest is great
god eater three 
code vein
youll have to go back to the twozerozerozerosthe last games had any kind of challenge
shatterline in coop mode has enemy soliders that move exactly as you describe free on steam
try gears of war four  five really good ai made me think the longer i played it the enemies were learning my patterns
fear
the division two
unreal tournament twokfour
every good shooter should have the things you listed i suggest destiny two or division two
they are solely about fighting mixed groups of these enemy types
some really smart people created a real ai bot with machine learning for rocket league its called nexto its not exactly what youre looking for but interesting for people into game ai
you said youre burned out on strategy games but unfortunately thats what i have
ai war fleet command is an rts inspired by supreme commander that can only be played multiplayer in coop because the ai is good very good as in if you beat the ai at maximum difficulty the developers consider it a bug good theres a sequel that is a little different but still good from what i hear i havent played too much of it
metal gear solid two
swat four you play the leader of a swat force your enemies will hide behind doors rush you if youre exposed etc you have to be very methodical if you want you and your team to survive and also follow police procedures theres no saving and enemycivilian locations will change each time you play a mission
its a bit old but still worth it i suggest the fourth have specifically because it is the most immersive unlike its predecessors this one was developed by the developers of bioshock fear
halo infinite metal gear solid five the enemies will put on helmets if you get too many headshots they will use flashlights if you attack bases commonly during night they will wear gas masks if you use smoke grenades a lot they will also not run directly towards gun fire
backfourblood the bots are really good its sort of horde shooter so the enemy ai isnt really smart
not sure but maybe halo firefight
far cry two  redux mod on redux difficulty
sons of the forest
guild wars the first one enemy ai actually work in groups against you and even use formation they even make judgment calls about remaining in your aoe if they think they might be able to kill you first or getting out of them they also can use their skills in combination with each other
army of two
death stranding but id call it more of a smart immersive environment as opposed to necessarily any real enemies
halo infinites ai is really advanced while playing forge firefight they use flank strategies and end up overwhelming me and my friends
adding on to this theres a free demo on steam of the upcoming game trepang two which seems to try to capture the same magic as far as combat goes its not a horror title afaik 
i had good fun with the demo and i feel i can recommend it to anyone who liked fear
fear still holds up nowadays on ai aswell
i second this the best strat against those clones is to keep moving and check your back often
redacted is smarter than mee i swear
i second rainworld especially scavengers
its interesting because the ai there isnt really that sophisticated
it basically boils down to
decision tree of the type used in every other aaa game ever with the caveat that certain paths in the tree get activated if the player has managed to avoid getting killed by the xenomorph in certain ways gives the illusion of learning but its really just a hardcoded only allow this to happen n times before going down a better path
make sure the alien is vaguely in the same general area as the player
there are no fancy neural networks or new technologies here they just did a better job of writing their decision trees than other games
the last of us part ii has tremendously good ai plus different enemy groups and types will have hugely different playstyles some groups are really aggressive others employ more tactics and slowly flank in even when not actively fighting the ai is great at reacting to the environment commenting on traps and dead allies
added bonus of the ai generally behaving more believably and not getting a permanent gps fix on you once you enter combat i love that you can actually reliably flee or catandmouse if you can break line of sight and theyll search for you where they last saw you instead of just homing in on your real time location
ive never played a single player game that had the balls to let an npc shoot you in the face from twozero yards away within a second of establishing line of sight one of the most challenging experiences i ever had i heard they cut enemies that could sneak up on you unfortunately because players never notices them until it was too late
im been obsessed with this game for a year now the ai is indeed fascinating
i second sniper elite five ive had times where i could reliably work with the ai to flank an enemy sniper in vs mode
sorry man the ai in wl is garbage aimbots hivemind never reloading their weapons going in straight line guys with uzis that can snipe you with no recoil breakpoint made them way more realistic
there are a couple of stalker games on steam which one has this or is it all of them
i find a bit hit and miss but when when itss good its really good
weird even with the ai on high settings for me on ground branch they dont behave smartly ready or not does ai better than ground branch
great game but ai is not that kind of smart op is looking for
whats smart about code veins ai
yes to unreal tournament twokfour  that is one game i still keep on every computer i own  loads of content always a fun time  
the screenshots look very much like the game is in the same alley as fear will check it out 
didnt they already do that in mgsone  i remember them doing that agreed 
all of them tho i think its shown the best in the first two shadow of chernobyl and clear sky tho call of pripyat has the best ai overall
checkout stalker anomaly too  its a free game built on a custom engine based on the stalker engine  everyone will say to start with soc but definitely keep anomaly on your radar as something to graduate to
the stalker series has its own subreddit i recommend checking that out  the original games work on modern system but there is a baseline community patch for each that fixes tons of bugs andor adds qol features  like zrp for soc
stalker uses something called alife which is like an grand ai director that connects all ai from every region so even when youre not around the ai is still doing stuff
when you combo this and how the ai fights with mods they become some of the best ai around  like literally sneaking around cover to attack and whatnot  theyll do this stuff in the vanilla game but stuff like anomaly makes it feel like real encounters
i also recommend the game fear  the ai in that uses something called goap the goal oriented action planning system  you can watch stuff about it but it makes the encounters with the ai combatants feel organic
yeah ill take an advanced ai which is occasionally very dumb over an ai that just sits in cover all day
the team mate ai is decent in ron also if you wanna play solo
the companion ai is fantastic
im late to the mgs party and havent played the other mgs games but youre right that its definitely not a new concept that said afaik its still rare for games with stealth mechanics to implement them well eno that running and hiding feels viable after detection a lot of action games just tack on stealth as an afterthot
this is kind of indepth analysis rgames needs more of 
this channel is great at breaking down ai into an understandable concept and showing us behind the curtain 
i honestly think halo three was the peak of gaming  amazing campaign with great gameplay cinematicinteractive storytelling the beautiful music that i still listen to in my car from time to time perfect couch coop unlimited amounts of fun for online matchmaking for both competitive and casual custom games that benefited big time from the creativity generated within forge mode and then the theater mode where you could go back and review all your shit  hell i got into filmmaking more seriously because of making machinimas with my friends using halo three  it never felt like a dry experience  you could play halo three in any way and still have a blast
eleven years later and halo five removed couch coop which essentially kills a lot of the essence that was halo  i think studios have forgotten what made gaming great and should really go back and revisit halo three to find out why it lasted for so long on the shelves as everyones must have video game
edit
watch this if you need more reasons why youtubeeightafmpmtvthreela
hey everyone just wanted to pop in here and say thanks for watching the video thats my soothing scottish tones you hear in the video  as stated in the video a couple years back i did a video on halo twowwwyoutubecomwatchvnusevenonesevensdeightouc which sadly hasnt aged terribly well but this gave me a nice opportunity to return to the series tho i did manage to spell max dyckhoffs name wrong  sorry  i was pleasantly surprised by how well halo three holds up having not played it again since i first bot the master chief collection a few years back
whether i can return to halo in the future im not sure  i only make videos when i can be one hundred confident in how the ai works in a given game  theres not a huge amount of information about halo four or five ive been able to find  right now the only halo game i know i can tackle is halo wars two which is really quite interesting when you know how that game works
dont have time to watch at the moment but man there isnt any other video game music that immediately strikes me like that piano at the beginning of the video what a fucking game
halo three will always be the pinnacle of gaming for me 
there is one word for the halo campaign legendary
hey cool i made this pretty surreal seeing my onezero year old gdc slides being used and he spelled my last name wrong  
when i first heard about halo wars i was super hyped because i thot maybe they were going to make an rtsshooter in which the units you produced would fight each other in the same way the ais in the halo series fot each other which would have been amazing too bad it ended up being a mediocre and pretty standard rts
i used to reload some of the larger fights between humancovenantflood forces in halo just to watch them play out in different ways there was one particular fight i remember from the first game where an infected human had a rocket launcher and the whole fight hinged on whether they could land a good rocket hit before dying 
conceptually this is a very intuitive system but it sounds like something that could easily go wrong or have major issues that leads to bad behavior like random covenant running across the map to an objective five zones behind the player or running in circles as they thrash between tasks or something like that
its impressive that the system largely blended into the background of the game and did pretty much exactly what it was meant to do
halos always had interesting ai just at the squad level with relatively simple enemies that lead to emergent but manageable behavior when they are encountered in groups of varying pieces an evolution of game design as old as gaming but done really well with an understanding of the right level of complexity to make the player feel good this system just takes that up a level
this video was sooooo cool
i really wonder if there other non bungie fps games that use just as an advanced ai task system i personally feel like we havent had that same level of ai depth since halo reach in an fps game even single player focused fps games like far cry or bioshock feel like they lack the same level of ai advancements
halo three is still my favorite of the halo pve sandboxes all thanks to the combination of the ai tree the fantastic environment designs the equally fantastic ai placements in those areas the weapons sandbox full of old favorites the familiar yet fresh vehicle sandbox and last but definitely not least the deployable equipment that added some minor variety depending on the player also congratulations for all involved in the brute redesign that was an incredibly successful overhaul of a fairly meh halo two enemy
i honestly never really knew just how complicated ai got in shooters 
i always figured it was functions as simple as
if in combat  take cover and kill player otherwise patrol area until player arrives
with auxiliary functions like close to vehicle  get in vehicle 
knowing that theres this much to it honestly makes me want to replay the game and pay more attention to what each enemy is doing 
excellent video this guy definitely just got a new viewer cant wait to check out his other stuff 
itd be nice to see more of this but id be surprised if this post gets much traction 
years ago when i joined this sub in its early days coming from rgaming there was a lot more interesting discussion and content now it feels a lot more dramarumor centric 
mark browns game analysis is good too
unfortunately more of is hard since the channel almost exclusively posts only on ganes they can talk to devs about or have already talkes about
if you like this sort of technical and creative insight into games id suggest checking out noclips work theyre doing some incredible stuff
not only that this video is the prime example of one thing in which halo three honestly the whole trilogy did better than most modern games ai the ai in halo feels incredible and i never seen such a flexible ai in modern shooter that can seamlessly change from a role to another swap weapons ride vehicles act differently depending on which seat of the vehicle theyre in they can even drive for you and all of these while also engaging in midscale battle with multiple allies and enemies
not to mention halo four and five promoted all that competitive bullcrap while they shouldve been promoting the most unique part of the franchise custom games there is no other shooter that allowed you to create custom maps and custom modes with the depth even halo three allowed players dumped hundreds of hours on stupid gamemodes like fat zombie and jenga tower and it was amazing
halo five is a pile of wasted potential thats why im hoping theyll learn their lesson with the next title one of the best things they could do is custom game cross play 
absolutely halo three is probably my favorite game of all time like its actually astounding how good it is 
as someone that hasnt played much halo beyond the first two and loves couch multiplayer would you say it holds up nowadays ive been looking for a four player splitscreen shooter and im not a big fan of cod
not only that but the dlc that was released freed up the previously released dlc so you were getting a lot of free content and microtransactions hadnt ruined the base game
god damn youre so right i just got the master chief collection and that game holds up without even tryingand no hd makeover either you can spend hours just dicking about with the ai systems the physics etc i love halo three it will always have a place in my library
counterpoint the story falls apart as soon as you start to actually think about it edit articlehttpharuspistumblrcomposteightnineeightzerofourtwozerofivetwoeighteightwhyhalothreesstorywashorsecock the gameplay felt sluggish with a very low fov and the hit detection online was rubbish
yeah halo three was the best  i remember playing all the way thro four at a launch party and having a pretty good time but not a great one  i sat down a couple days later and played some three and realized that there was a lot missing from four
 oneone years later and halo five removed couch coop which essentially kills a lot of the essence that was halo
most people dont play couch coop even back then youd see more lone wolfs rather than people having guests attached to their profile 
halo five is still a great game shit campaign but on par multiplayer maybe slightly worse than three but they finally added a server browser to custom game i would have killed for that back in halo three it was painful to be locked out because the only lobby your friends were in was full onesix players
halo three was okay but in some respects was not as good as one and two it failed to get big traction and was overtaken by call of duty four which revolutionized multiplayer fps game design so peak of gaming nah
piano at the beginning of ocarina of time
yknow every video i somehow manage to make one tiny mistake somewhere that bugs me forever afterwards  i thot id got away with it this time and then nope  sorry about that
no i made this 
keep in mind that the ai for an fpss campaign mode is meant to be and should be very different than how it works for a balanced rts
halo wars was hampered i think by being designed for console i dont want to be pcmr or anything since theres plenty of games i prefer on console but i think that the controller gameplay forced the game to be more strategy oriented if the game had a fine unit control  micro layer to the gameplay itd probably a lot more fun and more authentic to halo because halo has never really been about two blobs of dudes just shooting each other other watching each other die theyd always have a lot of strafing back and forth rolling out of the way of each others grenades taking cover and so forth that you could express with a micro layer 
that said uavengerr said it best halo wars is for people who want to see more of the halo universe not necessarily those who want bigbig team battle between unsc and covvies  
i had the same hope for halo wars i wish it was common for games with goos mechanics and ai to have a devsandbox mode to create spawn points and choose enemy and pick ai patterns for a skirmish
at least people seemed to enjoy halo wars
i dont think you know what the word sandbox means
its sort of devolved into gaming news 
imagine the upvotes if the title mentioned ea or lootboxes
i dont see the drama but i also dont read to far into the comments
i miss posts like thisnpredditcomrgamingcommentsuxpil
hey thanks for watching the video thats my voice  and my words too  my social tracker was telling me this video had a lot of traffic coming from reddit  i think i found the source 
indeed youre correct videos are driven from actually sourced material either existing talks or posts such as both my halo twowwwyoutubecomwatchvnusevenonesevensdeightouc and halo three videos andor from actually interviewing developers who are happy to talk to me my recent videos on spec ops the linewwwyoutubecomwatchvybgbopdue and doom twozeroonesixwwwyoutubecomwatchvrcodtwioefi are a good example of this  simply put if i dont know for certain how it works the video doesnt get made which is a shame as there are some topicsgames ive had to abandon over the years as i just could not find the info i needed to bring it all together
case studies typically appear once a month  i work as an ai researcher and freelance game ai programmer so this is my eveningweekend jobpet project  whilst i often keep topics close to my chest my patreon supporters usually get a month or two headsup i do have some very exciting games lined up for the next threesix months  one of which is my first legitimate exclusive as i was invted to a aaa studio to see their ai systems for a title that was released earlier this year
thats the kind of in depth content im after tho im happy to wait between posts as i know work is being put in
im just glad that despite threefourthree promoting all their esports stuff forge mode is still improving with each iteration id even say that the best part of halo five is the forge and that halo fives forge is the best so far so its still nice to see that threefourthree isnt throwing that aspect of halo away
the custom game environment for halo five is more powerful than ever tho there is even a custom games browser and plans to add one to mcc it wont be shocking at all to see similar support for infinite with cross play 
i dont know much about game design and the industry always scared me because of the way employees are treated  but the one thing thats always called me to want to make a game is the desire for a wonderful game that blended the map editors of timesplitters far cry and halo forge far cry five got soooo close with the frankly fucking amazing map editor but shit the bed with two game modes deathmatch and team deathmatch and a god awful lobby browser system  just mix that in with the halo forge browser system and its custom game mode stuff
i just want to be able to mold the environment and add in custom inside level design and have eno game modes to have crazy dumb fun for years  man what i wouldnt do to have the predator mode from far cryinstincts predator
if there was one game i could wish into existence itd be that
 there is no other shooter that allowed you to create custom maps and custom modes with the depth even halo three allowed 
umm  have you seen the stuff people are making in halo fives forge or are you just running on the hatetrain for karmanostalgia
because people are making little missions not just maps levels and game types but missions with objectives and asymmetrical online play
switches that open doors spawn units turn off lights across a building  players are making some amazing stuff and better yet the devs actually incorporate it into the online playlists in rotations to show off the coolest new modes and maps
for halloween its freaking versus lfourd in halo for example
cant say for halo four but halo five was where the kept competitive in mind from the start of creation
i put quotes around competitive because the competitive community didnt like what they did the casual audience felt alienated and the halo community ended up with a game that did not really cater to any audience despite threefourthrees claims
if you want to see good ai play arma
plenty of other shooters had that level or more of customiseability pc games of then and before were built around user creations and modding in mind halo just reached a shit ton more players
with the name halo infinite im really hoping that somehow ties into not only the story but also the forge and custom games modes maybe itll have optional crossplay and a huge emphasis on sharing modes and them continually adding new pieces and features to forge kinda like a halo platform for years to come 
a man can dream 
i replayed two three odst reach and four with a friend recently they all hold up and three was definitely the best 
id think so  i played so much of it as a kid with my friends that it was always very enjoyable  i know for halo three you can play the campaign with four players plus theres a lot to do if you connect to xbox live tho i cant speak for the xboxone version  i honestly wouldnt mind being able to play it with my wife now but not interested in buying a bunch of hardware to warrant the nostalgia
halo three is hands down the best splitscreen shooter ever made halo reach is also fantastic in that regard
there only one that was made free it its lifetime was the heroic pack the first one
eeeeeeeeh lets not give bungie improper credit i was in highschool when halo three came out and it was a game i remember having to save up my own money for to buy because my parents refused to buy videogames for me
when the first dlc map pack came out they took away literally the only playlist that i played big team battle eight v eight with vehicles was locked behind the map pack you couldnt play it without it made me drop the game pretty quickly with a bad sour taste in my mouth
every time bungie does something shady with microtransactions and or dlc pricing in destiny hint they do it a lot i am still reminded of this having a game i paid sixzero dollars for to play big team battle and then having that big team battle taken away from me
a lot defined here as one map followed by the first of two map packs if you bot the second one
except you had to buy the first or get locked out of some playlists
then again the rage about microtransactions ruining the base game says that youre both just griping at little and probably didnt play much of any halo online either

yup sounds like this guy didnt play halo two when it came to hit detection the br spread in hthree was abysmal but i did like the spawn system somewhat better tho
a lot of people here have nostalgia goggles on and i say that as someone who still plays mcc every few weeks
it failed to get big traction
lmao it averaged twozerozerok concurrent players for the first two years
are you old eno to remember halo three or rather did you even play halo three
it definitely did not fail to get big traction at onethree million copies sold it helped sell millions of consoles and gave the threesixzero a huge starting lead last gen it also was able to maintain hundreds of thousands of concurrent peak player count for up to three years after its release halos downfall only really started with halo four
weve never really seen an rts where each unit was a unit engaging in fps behavior not to my knowledge it would be new and pretty wild but the computing requirements would be pretty nutty i bet 
its a sandbox but not an openworld sandbox you can have openworld games with linear objectives and railroaded toolsets and viceversa
a good half of levels like the silent cartographer ive played a lot more of halo one than three are sandboxstyle arenas chained together youre given a few tools and an immediate objective and otherwise given free reign to fight the way you want no corridors or forced weaponry
something like this might honestly be more likely to generate interest in rgamedev
honestly ill take the trade off since its meant a bit more positivity in this sub how negative and cynical this sub was especially compared to now was really unbearable
forge is improving in its complexity and what you cna do but
halo five textures lighting and objects look horrendous in forge compare halo five forged maps and their overall look and feel to halo three 
its laable halo three forge maps look amazing while hfive look like twozerozerotwo games  
the custom game support was a way too late in the games life 
didnt mean to write the three i meant in general the forge in halo five is amazing and should be promoted more by the devs i hate how halo forge on pc had such a silent release
yeah but the incorporated that stuff into reach sure the forge is good now but its three years on from a game with good gunplay and bad mechanics that takes up one hundredgb of your xbox not worth it at all
not with an internal editor far cry is the closest maybe 
halo infinite describes its expected lifetime infinite
its a service a game as a service 
two thousand seven minecraft marks the start of this and rightly so the flood  no pun intended of early access zombie survival games was the end was the golden age for indie imo its still good but then it was awesome
ah well im twosix and while fortnite isnt my thing i dont take issue with it it must be pretty fun since so many people play it 
honestly think that if halo three were released today itd be a phenomenon again
does it have firefight that mode sounds like a lot of fun to me also can you add bots
it just sucks that you cant add bots  i remember spending hours playing matches of timesplitters with my friends and bots 
they also released the chill out remake cold storage for free
of course if you wanted to play it in matchmaking at the time you needed to purchase the legendary map pack for eightzerozero microsoft points fuck those points
thanks don mattrick 
you are wrong the heroic map pack is interesting really bungie in twozerozeroseven was a small group of talented developers that just wanted to make a great game the executive bs you see these days is not the same company the dlc costed money at release and was publicly said to be free that spring dlc playlists were added nothing was removed at least due to dlc playlists were pretty dynamic
halo three did have dlc locks eventually but that was not really a big factor until they made odst which came with all halo three dlc
i went online with halo three march three zeroeight and i did not get the heroic pack until it was free and guess what when i first started playing all i played was btb  literally first thing i fired up i remember it fondly if you are going to shit on old bungie at least get your facts straight
nah halos downfall started with a combination of reach and mms taking off via cod four yearly game releases became a thing and halo was never that 
weve never really seen an rts where each unit was a unit engaging in fps behavior not to my knowledge it would be new and pretty wild but the computing requirements would be pretty nutty i bet 
men of war comes very close to fitting the definition assault squad is great if you wanna check it out
thats my understanding as well fps games just have less ai than rts games so they can have smarter logic for each of them individually
you also want it to be more strategic and predictable in an rts if your units are too smart its not fun for you to control and if your enemies are too unpredictable its too hard or annoying to be prepared
company of heroes springs to mind the way squads shoot at each other and use cover
that doesnt make it a sandbox
rtruegaming fills a gaming discussion void sometimes has been awhile since ive been on there tho
i hope that with xbox now able to haves mods and things like that for bethesda games that they input something like this for halo infinite so you could add your own textures and things to forge so everything doesnt look so samey i doubt it will happen tho 
three months after the games release was way too late for you huh i feel sorry for you with an attention span that short
thats kind of what i mean i hope thats the case if done well that could mean endless halo content 
halo three odst does and i believe the game came with halo three multiplayer on a second disk  you are unable to add friendly bots but with firefight mode you can go one v all the enemies ha
reach has this as well i just didnt care for all the new elements reach added felt very cod like
holly shit i totally forgot about those points that takes me back
i remember map packs were always eightzerozero points but you could only buy points in increments of five hundred or one hundredzero so you always had some left over
i do have my facts straight i remember trying to play btb and it saying you do not have all the maps for this playlist
bungie in twozerozeroseven was a small group of talented developers that just wanted to make a great game 
is that why jason jones checked out during development  bungie was not small in twozerozeroseven ms had just bot them a giant new office to fit the huge influx of people for halo three may they were already tired of halo and the senior people were basically looking forward to destiny
edit you replied and  while i was responding but you are right maybe ms didnt buy the building however the move to the new building was done prior to the split from ms while bungie was still owned by them they also needed a new building to fit the team which was large at the time it wasnt some small group of handpicked devs completing a passion project like you make it seem
that isnt a reliable source considering that they think branching narratives are an example of emergent gameplay
that same page you linked states
a sandbox game is also known as an openworld or freeroaming game
which i would say isnt true when you look at some open world games such as witcher three the terms arent interchangeable
id agree that halos campaign itself might not qualify as a sandbox but the custom games sure do
were getting downvoted for pointing out the obvious halo has always been linear not a sandbox this comment section is full of idiots
rtruegaming has a bit of a track record of focusing on discussing and not debate tho its pretty frequent that ill go into a comment thread and say something like i overall agree with the discussion going on but there can be exceptions like x or there are still issues with y so i understand the concern and think the opinions are valid only to get downvoted almost exclusively they seem to like discussion as long as everyone agrees which still isnt what i want out of a good subreddit
people may also enjoy rvideogameanalysis 
well its be fine if they had actual good textures and allowed us to tweak some settings such as scaling size diffuse color noise luster ambient lighting etx 
three months custom games didnt get good support until nearly a year after launch if youre referring to them adding janky and broken assault griffball ctf oddball and king of the hill then youre not talking about the right time frame 
i really dont want this
i want a solid release every four years 
i dont want to be milked for drip fed content i dont want grindy systems simply designed to lengthen content longevity simply to give a small amount of content to grind 
games as a service are simply not as content rich fully featured or complete packages compared to a full release 
they just make more money by drip feeding content 
ok thanks for the tips appreciate you
if you had to use microsoft points on another third party currency which left you even more change it was frustrating as hell
that is not true ms points were sold at onesixzerozero and fourzerozerozero respectively 
you buy a map pack and you are left with onezero eightzerozero ms points
the system works fine for msrp stuff it is when you add deals and other small purchases to the equation once you break the multiples of five that is when the store became a massive headache as the store grew the worse standardized prizing got by the time the end of the ms point era came you had indies for onefive xda for as low as one you had avatar stuff gamerpics and a vastly growing store front with constant sales
look man if you want i can dig up the details 
halo heroic map pack was a planned free piece of content that was restricted to dlc playlists when it launch that winter at premium price 
you are wrong sorry 
id agree that the forge mode is a sandbox but stating that the campaign is sandbox is ridiculous
your problem is that you think sandbox means it has to be an open world game like red dead or assassins creed when it really means a type of gameplay design that doesnt restrict the players choices on how to tackle problems presetened to them and how the player gameplay systems and ai can interact with each other in a number of different ways game design like that isnt restricted to open world games halo has a series of levels mechanics and even a whole spin off game based around these design principals
 this comment section is full of idiots
here are two in fact
 they seem to like discussion as long as everyone agrees which still isnt what i want out of a good subreddit
it is to to maintain a community like that most folk on reddit are not intellectuals and arent able to divorce themselves from their personal feelings or understand the framework of a discussion you cant really do objective discussions about things when people arent willing to treat it academicallyimpartially it doesnt help that reddit empowers folks to believe that their opinion is worth the same as anyone elses opinion by giving them the ability to updownvote content regardless of how informedobjective it is or isnt 
so far my favorite place to talk about games is over at rpatientgamers tho folks who are willing to wait for games and arent as invested in those franchises are usually willing to be a bit more impartial about them thats a sad bit of witcher three and dark souls circlejerking from time to time but honestly thats almost inescapable in general so you take what you can get 
no im talking about forge and custom games which released december the year the game came out under three months from the release date
yes and no
early on in the xbox threesixzeros lifecycle if you were buying ms points with a credit card you could only do so in five hundred or one hundredzero point increments the cards were always onesixzerozero or fourzerozerozero it took them until twozeroonezero or so to change the credit card purchases to reflect the card ones
post from twozeroonezerowwwbungienetenusforumsposttwotwosixonesixthreetwo where people are telling this guy he needs all the dlcs to play social big team battle
the campaign is definitely several sandboxes
by your definition then a huge percentage of games are sandboxes which ridiculous search for the sandbox tag on steam and see what you games you get
but most of the time when people write something negative about witcher or dark souls they dont get downvoted into oblivion i really like how accepting the community is of others opinions one of my favourite subs overall my only problem is that discussions tend to repeat
the thing is the game didnt have eno sustainability to last three months imo  you completed the campaign in a few hours never went back to it because its an awful campaign then went and played one of the few modes on multiplayer there were five on release five all of which were competitive i dont mind comp its fun from time to time but it was always tryhards there was no just social slayer where you can mess about for a bit challenge yourself by only using the magnum or something
there was that warmode tho right yeah well that mode sucked between the shitty ai and the lootboxes and the three maps on release it got boring fast
after a month generous i know youd done everything it was only months later when it started to get a few more maps modes etc and finally forge but by then it was too little too late
soyoure talking about when the custom games came out with none of those game modes when it was still barebones     
custom games and forge not being in the game on release as they should have been    
that isnt custom games support to brag about a year after release when the custom games were finally robust is when to brag about also custom games servers were not implemented until much later than three months 
when the first dlc map pack came out they took away literally the only playlist that i played
you give me something from a time unrelated to your post
as i said you are wrong
i can claim things that make no sense too hey guys call of duty is the best indie puzzle adventure franchise ever made prove me wrong see
theres difference between a sandbox game and a sandbox i would consider a sandbox game to be an open world game a sandbox within a game is a space that allows for creativity and improvisation a good example would be something like half life two where you have a sort of sandbox where you can play around with the physics and mechanics of the game like you can in a halo game
whistles howdy now isnt that a fine amount of goalpost moving youd think it was a kids soccer league there
my point is that bungie has a history of locking people out of content they had at launch regardless of the timeline 
have you played halo
or hitman which has a bunch of sandboxes connected with a linear story and progression
lmao tetris and pac man are sandbox games then
fucking threefourthreei defense team
halo five is trash and always will be three months is way too late and nobody is going to stick around waiting for features to be added that should have been there since launch i dont buy a steak to have half of it come after i finish the first half 
your point is irrelevant when your reasoning is wrong
a billion times you
yeah thats another really good example
wow you have issues it takes a disturbed individual to look at someone cat in a lie and go yeah well  theyre right anyway because i like what they say
you must have voted last election
hes not wrong tho 
yeah man we just disagree on what sandbox means i think calling halo linear is kinda misleading each scenario is ripe for being played around with
making something deeper than it is youre way overthinking shit about a video game did i offend you that much relax bronie
perhaps you both are daff i literally used his quote about how when the first dlc came out btb became locked behind it he was wrong and his way to identify his claim was from a post three years after the map pack came out 
sorry you guys have poor comprehension skills
just because you can engage things in different ways doesnt make it a sandbox dude the same way that world of warcraft isnt a sandbox either its called a theme park mmo because of how on rails the gameplay is and something like eve online or minecraft are sandbox because of the amount of freedom and lack of objectives 
how was he wrong
youtubeihssthreepjuyug 
at sixtwotwo even one of halos developers calls it a sandbox game theres a whole boat load of these developer diaries from bungie and i can recall them using the term sanbox to describe their gameplay systems a few times besides this video 
edit again at fivefivenine in that same video they have a developer with the title of lead sandbox designer
wow once again
he said 
btb was unplayable for those without dlc when the first map released and he is wrong 
btb had no such thing until shortly after halo three odst which came out at the end of twozerozeronine 
it is a wrong point of reference and the argument really does not hold if you use the right point of reference which would have been along the lines of 
i played halo three before it got dlc and when i fired it up three years later after multiple revisions i could not play btb it is quite the different story 
ultimately someone is trying to throw people under the bus based on false information i get it bungie sucks now but if you want to attack them for breathing life into a dying game twothree years after it came in out and asking for your money in the process you can just gtfo 
you had people that charge fifteen a month and sixty a year for gaas games and we want to be up in arms over requiring you to spend maybe like sixzero after years of free support  to refresh a game things were different than halo three is a prime example of paid dlc problems in the way you would not think it did not split a community it just added onezero playlists with new maps people played for a week or two it is safer to say map packs were a waster of money and added nothing to the base experience of the game
the game had three core alterations
one base release game 
two heroic map being free
three halo three odst  when all content became universal and required money 
halo three after odst was a new behemoth with maps for your maps in all playlists i played halo three for years and if some run of a mill joe who fires halo three up after not playing it for twothree years wants to get his panties in a bunch that is his problem i needed the expansion that was integrating all dlc into the core experience 
paid mp dlcs are a joke because despite what people say they are not paywalls they are broken promises for those actually willing to pay for more only game series that did not have this problem was bf but it had a plethora of other paid dlc problems 
i played halo three for threeyears regularly and bot four map packs and then odst and i can tell you first hand halo three never locked the core modes behind dlc paywalls until they made a standardized rerelease in the form of odst which was two years after the game launched well after the first dlc as op claims
unless the game is very formulaic in which case the ai is just reproducing a template and filling it in with ai generated variableswhich is feasible currently requires no ai and is somewhat trivial to do we are probably closer to colonizing mars we are also probably closer to simulating a full human brain why because thats essentially what it takes
there are so many fields of expertise intertwined that ais will need to be much more general than they currently are and that generality will almost certainly need to match the human brain games have a purpose but ais are all ad hoc that means they do not plan they just make it up thats why the only way i see them creating games is if they follow very strict rules if they ever get to a point where its possible to create a truly aigenerated game then they will almost certainly be comparable to the human intellect thats very far off and thats not even getting into the originality problem
also notice aigenerated game is vague using aigenerated content in games is certainly possible while it is also possible to play games with chatgpt and possibly ask it to generate basic rules for a textbased game in that case its possible already however if you are comparing it to games a game developer can make what i said in the first two paragraphs applies
extremely far unless you want to play shitty video games
very far away better to think of chatgpt as a chatbot which it actually is than as an ai it has no conceptual understanding of what is says
i think rendering will take big hops in the future like snapchat ai filters but on steroids that can do all the basic post processing things cheaply already happening with the render low res  upscale with ai
whats the point of consuming generated ai content tho im not saying that it cannot generate good content but a future where any media i consume is generated by an ai feels extremely dystopian to me it has no soul its like its been designed to maximize profits like always
i dont want a random game fully aigenerated i want to listen to a real person comment his reasoning behind game design decisions i want someone to tell why a balancing decision was made i want artists to know how it felt to make their characters and designs alive i want to read the sound designers experience while recording and making sounds for their games i want to see everything put together with passion a dedication
ai has nothing of that i can see ai as an assistance tool and i can value it id rather train an ai to analyze code ans detect bugs with precision for example but i cant see why anyone would like ai games to be a thing
yeah i think that is not for tomorrow but imo that could give good surprises maybe inovative gameplay or mechanics i think that could be interesting to have something that doesnt think like a human
check out the game code here feel free to repost any fixes dtwosevendsevenfourcninebsixsharedcslightlydevcom  
assets credit to foozle foozleccitchiovoidmainship
not that far i dont think i have been playing around and have an ai that can make all the objects for a game eg the units terrain map and their code from a single prompt asking the user for the theme 
appcambrianggappcambriangg is the site i am putting these generators at the moment the site will let you build cards and decks of cards to play top trumps with
theres not going to be an easy way to have a fully aigenerated game any time soon as ai isnt yet designed to do much without human input
ai will continue to be used in game creation and realistically has been used since we had games with procedural generation  most ai is still far closer to basic procedural generation than it is to human intelligence
since you can train ai to play games it should in theory be able to improve games too from its experience but since most ai only has one or a few models of knowledge it would be difficult to create a game that can compete with what a human can make were slower but we understand far more concepts
if youre trying to use ai as a short hand for effortless game then you dont need ai you just need a pipeline and being completely careless about the games you put out   
i want to die
we have some stuff in the works at rthemirrorspace were pretty early but id love to get your thots when were closer to it
about as far of a drop from your ego down to your iq
chat gpt did not create code it just took available code you can google yourself thats why it will be often buggy and can use outdated deprecated syntax or methodsfunctions 
we are still far away not this or next year and probably not next five years
probably not long before as a gimmick most things in a game are advertised as ai generated and promoted thro dumb fluff pieces as a selling point then there will probably follow a period of shovelware with terrible gameplay mechanics to turn people off from that for awhile
define aigenerated game we can talk about some elements like assets or code maybe even idea but ai does not possess capability for creative process it will not know if content it generated is appealing if code it generated works without issues if idea it generates is interesting to play thro not to mention it will never go outside defined model it learned on
not very far at all we just launched our alpha last week you can turn social media trends into dreamworlds using ai all art made inhouse if you like fortnite or only up you may like auxworld
so it will kick off on mobile next year got it
try not think about commercial games but hfive mini games for side events would that be possible
shitty video games make billions of dollars so im ok with it
this makes me think of the google rumors earlier about sentient ai i wasnt mean to discuss this merely with chatgpt but i wonder if sentient has any relationship with game making tho
im just wondering since ais are fed by human data would they achieve something beyond humans for instance the weird finger thingy from ai arts
i dont know what an hfive mini game is or a side event so maybe
they really dont
simple eno
if the game is shitty no one would like it
if no one would like it no one would buy it or spend money in it
if no one would buy it it would not make money
so no if game makes a lot of money it means it appeals to a huge audience and this means it cant be objectively shitty no matter how do you hate it
its just some hype the google pr team put out
that what i was thinking of those weird stuff ai can produce sometimes those weird stuff turns aesthetically pleasant even if there is a good chance that ninenineninenine of what it can produce is garbage i think you can have gold in those zerozeroone  
does feeding a machine human knowledge will automaticaly produce something human already knows  i dont know at first i would say no
that reminds me the infinite monkey theoremenwikipediaorgwikiinfinitemonkeytheorem  humans produces billions of prompts which produce garbage but one of them will produce the best mechanics we could think of  
this is just my opinion maybe the is nonsense for ai professionals
infinite monkey theoremenwikipediaorgwikiinfinitemonkeytheorem 
the infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text such as the complete works of william shakespeare in fact the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times however the probability that monkeys filling the entire observable universe would type a single complete work such as shakespeares hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low but technically not zero
this game has a really difficult and interesting ai
also you do know that there is an ai game jam happening this week that just started todayhttpaijamcom right
also check out for more aimachine learning and games goodness
i havent played much of it but prismata is supposed to have a good ai for making decisions based on the state of the board
black and white
not indie however nba twokonenfl twokone back in the day would learn how you played which plays you favored which side of the field you preferred and adjust accordingly
while not at all an indie game this made me think of the second pokemon trading card game game for gameboy color the team gr m one for a gameboy game the ai got really good near the end of the game coming up with some really clever tactics it just shows that advanced hardware and tons of compute power isnt necessary to give the impression of an intelligent opponent
i made robodrift err am making it 
neural network driving trainer thing
id check out overgrowth  the rovergrowth forum is active and heres an idea of frequency of ai discussion
its not quite a learning algorithm however as i believe those would be computationally intensive for real time games and would require a lot of manual training to become competent
also even if you managed to make such an algorithm perform well you would eventually end up dumbing it down and making it slower in terms of time between actions and intentionally make mistakes so it doesnt overwhelm the player
finite state machines are proven to perform well in games and offer a lot of flexibilitychallenge so that may be the best course of action
per thousand 
section two emergent  of article  ai war fleet 
in a quote from the developer chris park there are a ton of rts games out there that are fun to playthe key weakness that they almost all share in my opinion is ai that falls apart in advanced play  ai war is developed using emergent ai which differs from standard game ai in that it doesnt follow decision trees or in other words the ai does not have an easily predictable pattern that can be exploited as in most games instead the ai makes decisions on an individual unit level a concept the developer coins as decentralized intelligence 
theres a lot of negativity towards machine learning from a game design perspective in some of the posts there 
personally i feel like a lot of this is due to a lack of creative thinking machine learning probably shouldnt be used for creating absolutely perfect ais that beat the player every time but they could be used convincingly to make ais that feel a little bit more realistic ml could also be used to give ais more depth and unpredictability to be more interesting over a period of time
also for a pet game or something like that ml could be used to give the pet more of a sense of personality
 also for a pet game or something like that ml could be used to give the pet more of a sense of personality
black and white did exactly that ages ago  so its certainly something that does show up in games when someone comes up with a good use for it
the problem is that players react negatively to ais that act realistically ninenine of the time that one chance that the ai does something completely unexpected and likely very stupid can ruin the game experience
with ml you cant design an ai that works one hundred of the time thats now how ml works at all you can only get to a certain number of nines depending on the quality of your ai and your success condition programming
so its safer and cheaper to make a finite state machine ai as well as often creating a better game experience for the player
black and whites ai implementation is a giant spreadsheet with varying probabilities assigned to different actions if you punish the pet the probability of those actions decreases in the spreadsheet
it was very well done and balances somewhat the control needed to design a proper game and the ability to have emergent behavior 
for traditional games yes but i think to properly integrate ml the game has to be designed with it in mind from the outset the games design has to be such that the ai acting weird wont totally ruin the experience and actually lends to the enjoyment of the game the example i used above was a pet game the pet doing something very stupid might endear the pet more to the player 
i agree that ml isnt something that would work well in most existing game designs 
is that actually what it was or is that conjecture  i only ask because i remember a lot of stories at the time about some interesting behaviors that would not be likely to emerge from a spreadhsheet  one woman who had suffered from a messy breakup and spent the evening throwing all the men in her village against cliffs discovered later that she had tat her monster to  throw men against cliffs
its possible that they were all fake but between all the stories when it was out and their general contention that theyd rigged its behaviors up to be governed by a neural network i got the definite impression it was doing something more interesting than just maintaining a weighted list of behaviors
perhaps there was more to it i thot i had read at some point that the pets behavior was governed by a spreadsheet i imagine tho that with some fancy logic combined with a list of behaviors in a spreadsheet the pet could exhibit quite a bit of depth 
doing a bit of research i found this synopsis online for the ai in the first black and white 
unfortunately the original sources of the paper arent all easily found online anymore from the paper it seems like a lot of information is stored in a spreadsheet and then somehow a series of decision trees are constructed for the ai to abide by in different states 
there are a couple ways to look at this
one is that ai doesnt have to dictate the behavior of individual agents in a game but can be used to contribute to gameplay in other ways for example a friend of mine was recently streaming a vr game where he cast spells by drawing runes with the controller i didnt look at the games source code but id bet linear regression or some other machine learning algorithm was used to recognize what shapes he was trying to draw
there could be interesting applications of grouping algorithms in say mmos these can be used to identify trends in player behavior players doing x activity log in from y location and use z keyboard layout for example which can create useful analytics for developers or even drive automated ingame behaviors such as world events
the best application of a continuously learning algorithm i can think of would actually be as a training tool in esports you could in theory use a bunch of replays to teach an algorithm to not only play the game but to imitate a certain players style you could then try to play against that in preparation to play against that player
the idea of using machine learning to have individual enemies change behavior based on the individual players actions sounds neat but only until you really think about it not only is this probably not desirable enemy ai in games isnt bad because its the best devs can do its bad because that generally makes for the most enjoyable play but its just not how machine learning works unsupervised learning algorithms can require thousands of carefully curated data points to get useful changes in behavior a player doing a level a couple times will never get meaningful change
try rludology
i think its a dead end for most type of games game ai should be predictable and abusable an exception might be companion ais those are currently frustratingly bad
i saw a ping pong robot in a yt video that would learn ping pong from scratch by watching a human opponent but because it learned from the human it was unable to exceed that persons skill level i think that adaptive difficulty like that would be necessary for machine learning to be used in games so that ai can be unpredictable without becoming exceedingly difficult
to be fair this isnt a very good questionnaire if you plan on referring to this in your dissertation you should make a better questionnaire
answers are to broad
you can answer multiple times
you can pick multiple options when you shouldnt be able to
some questions should have wider variety of answers
there are a few reasons this is undesirable  folks have already pointed out that game ai is designed to provide a rich and fun experience and sometimes that means bots that are bad on purpose or behave nonoptimally in some ways  
another reason is the sheer expense in rl training and their limitations  deepmind and openai have been working on building rl agents for starcraftii and dota respectively for years have stables of ai researchers and millions of dollars for cloud budget to run their training  tho they are getting better and better results over time the bots cant even play the game without restrictions yet  their motivations are a bit different tho as theyre trying to push the boundaries in rl research and produce agents that can better generalize one benchmark being whether it can beat pro players regardless of whether those players have an enjoyable experience or not
if i were you id focus on openais dota project and deepminds starcraft two project these are the only successful attempts in my opinion and the games ive played relying on machine learning to train the ai at least in part failed completely and to my surprise the team didnt even understood just how bad their result was 
the main reason this happened is that the ais that play dota and starcraft two have large networks at their disposal large dedicated teams to properly train it and their final client gets to run on a very powerful machine against the players most games dont have the same resources to do the training properly both in terms of hardware and engineering work not to mention the most important aspect eno time and at the end of the day their work has to run as part of the same application with the game on the same pc that the player uses which might have to support pretty low specs so the ai has to also work with very limited hardware resources in the end further restricting the choice of alogrithms that can be used 
plot twist youd have to focus a lot on the impact of performance and hardware resources and somehow link them to subjective impressions of what that ai does or does not do well doable but definitely tricky has the advantage of letting you focus on the maths and making verifiable claims youd also have to somehow figure out how algorithms choice influences matters some algorithms might produce end results that are more believable but they might have the sideeffect of not being scalable and not being able to deal with situation when the dataset becomes more difficult to process because of how the game evolved up to that point shere increase of size or complexity derived from an edge case scenario 
in my experience but i cant back this up properly with examples as most studios dont talk a lot abot what the specifics the best gaming ai uses a combination of scripted behaviour and cached responses to certain parameteres this second part is where machine learning could be used effectively my only example would be a negative one creative assembly has attempted to use this method to train the ai of the total war series since rome ii it failed in the sense that when the ai was very effective at determining if it had superiority and brutally leveraging it when it did but it was extremely passive when the player prepared well and the advantage was on their side and its capacity of anticipation is greatly reduced with the evolution of the game in late game you mostly have opponents that are basic idiots thats generally poor game design thats another aspect youd have to focus on btw the main problem with ml is that it is designed to find the correct solution to a problem while the ai for any game has to be beatable so the ai trained with these methods would have to be proficient but ultimately beatable and this inevitably causes big problems for this you should also cover game design decisions and how it influences the end result
i think the forza drivatars are similar to this they learn from players play style and create an ai based from that every car you race against is based off another player its pretty cool but racing games are very different to other games in how ai is used you compete with the ai but not directly by interacting with them  you do your thing and they do theirs separately for the most part
without the right caps ai learning could end up being like an omniscient force that automatically beats people specifically because it learns their reactions far more accurately than we currently understand as possible
generally tho i think it could be really amazing if there are designed areas of ignorance lack of information and general capacity for misinterpretation of a players choices
samurai shodown is a fighting game that uses tensorflow
merley mimicking the player is pointless
it can serve as player replacement until a real player comes in thats fine
what i would like to see is ai that simulate characters
players arent that good at play a archetypal role of a character
you cannot add character traits and behaviour that are detrimental to their winning
ai controlled characters on the other hand can be both much superior to the player and be tragic defined by the faults of the character
there is a great opportunity to be had in mixing drama with ai
many of the anti ai comments ive read hear are incredibly short sighted 
yes there have been ai systems designed to beat the best players and no that would not be fun to play against 
but would that be the type of ai that game designers would implement absolutely not it wouldnt be enjoyable for anyone 
i bet it would be an ai that is trained by player interaction not with the end goal of decimating the player but to have unique and interesting interactions with the player even other npcs
dont think of starcraft or counterstrike think of a survival game where the wildlife is driven by learning ai imagine an animal learning it can get food from the player learning it is beneficial not to kill the player but to protect them congratulations you just domesticated dogs
imagine an open world rpg where instead of a predetermined list of quests are coded in some or all the quests are created by ai 
there are so many possibilities outside of bots with perfect aim or inhuman apm
i think that machine learning ai can be good for some games and not for others
it would be good in racing games because it could result in the ai taking more than one line around the course or making mistakes and having them actually be racing the other ai
a place where they might not work as well could be games like the division where enemies are expected to behave in a certain way for the level design and player strategies to work
theres this list with unexpectedfunny decisions ais sometimes make  
since the ais were more likely to get killed if they lost a game being able to crash the game was an advantage for the genetic selection process therefore several ais developed ways to crash the game
i am currently a researcher focused on mapping deep learning video analytics to realtime mobile hardware the big challenge i see for you is scalability particularly if you want to use deep reinforcement learning substantial realtime applications of drl already require more computing power for even a single actor than what is available in the average gaming pc or console remember that people are also using that gpu for its original purpose graphics rendering unless you are playing a game that doesnt require realtime processing ai based on drl is simply impractical
assuming that the lack of processing power is somehow removed from the equation you then run into the problem of generating adequate training data for the algorithm what is the ais interaction with the player if the game is a racing game where the ai acts independently of player actions then it might provide an interesting competitor if the ai is required to interact and respond to the player however it is likely going to break down similar to procedural ai when people find exploits in the game code training for emergent player behaviors would request extensive playtesting beyond what any gaming studio does today
plot twist the whole thing was written by an ai and we all actually just took a turing test inside of a turing test
i think they should actually be learning and not be too predictable it has to be a slow curve or a delayed reaction where the ai adapts to your playstyle you want to be continously challenged but not continously punished as a player also when the ai finds out how to use bugs
some of games use cheating more resources instead of true difficulty increase 
total war series for example big problem there as people hate that you get unfair but stupid ai
game ai should be predictable and abusable
i hate that believe with a passion games with an absolutely amazing mechanics and level design like ac and tomb raider become boring schlock because the ai is so easy to deal with at the same time wooden and clumsy games like dark souls are amazing experiences because so much can go wrong if you are not constantly concentrated
what about for fighting games what makes them fun is the need to read your opponent on the surface this probably sounds like requiring predictable ai but what makes reads interesting is that they arent guaranteed as the opposing player could be feinting to bait out an opportunity
deepmind sctwo ai is already a thing and it destroyed the proplayers
but the problem then become when all ai does is mass stalker and the pro player still get defeated even tho they used the right counter immortals how is that fun
that would depend completely upon your reward function  if you use rl with a reward function that accounts for player engagement and skill level admittedly hard to measure then an ai totally smashing players is less likely
it might be rather difficult to prevent deep rl ai from abusing bugs or rather game engine quirks
its an interesting design but i think players will not enjoy it so much
i recently was at a talk about a chess engine that adapted to the player because of what is known as the zone of proximal development if youre learning how to perform a task you learn faster if the difficulty level is always slightly ahead of your current level
in video games most players dont want to keep learning how to get better they want to learn how to get good eno i think
if difficulty keeps increasing it will feel like a task and not like a game
for those kind of games i agree that ai is currently done in the wrong way
the search space for a game like tw or civ is just too large for a simple model so the developers try have it do what they think are good strategies these are often not good eno when translated into a rigid rule set and cheats are necessary
if something like deepminds alphago could be trained to perform at specific levels of difficulty at these games we could have much better experiences go was often thot to be impossible to have an ai play because of the large search space too
on the other hand an ai that isnt prelearned but learns based on what the player is doing is going to be very frustrating
id love it if the guys who are doing the dota ai took a swing at total war i wonder what crazy cheese they would come up with
or racing games with rubber banding
dark souls is the epitome of predictable and abusable ai predictable doesnt mean easy or simple it can be extremely convoluted as long as its consistent
patterns have to exist for a player to learn and the player must be able to rely on what they learnt about enemy behavior
predictable doesnt mean easy but normally you are one vs many opponents it would suck if you couldnt predict how they respond if they were braindead its not  not fun but if you cant exploit them it feels unfair 
if you throw a rock and nineonezero times they hear the rock and investigate but oneonezero times they see the rock and turn around straight away and kill you that feels cheap and unfair
but feinting and baiting are then just as much valid moves as attacks are which ais should be able to do im not very familiar with fighting games other than smash bros melee but it seems to me that as long as any attack is blockablecounterable such an ai could very quickly become unbeatable and a delay on its inputs would have to be imposed
killer instinct actually implemented ai that learns from you they talk about it in this gdc presentation very intriguing youtubenineyydyjqoneglg
worth noting i saw it beaten when a player repeatedly faked a dropattack on two separate fronts and the ai blobbed its army to defend the attack each time while he just macrod the map
the ai had learned the best way to defend was with its full force but it had not come to understand the concept of a distraction as a result it was locked into a loop of distraction until defeat was inevitable
even learning ai can be exploited
even tho that demonstration was impressive one shouldnt ignore that deepmind was essentially cheating by human standards eg by controlling units simultaneously in a way that requires enormous camera movements for humans when deeprived of those advantages it fell to pretty standard abuse of ai behavior again
imo it demonstrates another problem general utilization of machine learning ai as well thema different agents of deepmind showed vastly different behavior and the developers cant explain why a certain agent exactly learned their behavior thus making adjustements to it very difficult in my understanding
yup im aware  theres contention about whether its praise is deserved however due to the mechanical perfection displayed versus what wed consider intelligence  regardless my point above still holds  it was expensive to develop it plays with restrictions tlo had to play as protoss couldnt play as zerg and the intention is to research ways to generalize by playing hard and complex games not to create fun or rich player experiences
the not really simple solution is to have a target of fivezero win probability instead of one hundred win probability to make it fun for the player so if the ai is doing too well itll still give ground to the player and equally try harder when the player seems to be dominating
depending on the game you dont need an ai that can learn in realtime the game can come with several pretrained ais of different difficulties the developers just need to make sure that those are bugfree
or honestly to end up just outright cheating people often talk about ai beating humans in csgo or dota soon but in the end arent those ai basically using scripts and aimbots
if the ai are using means that are traditionally considered cheating then does it make any of their win meaningful
maybe if the option is there or it is an own gamemode there are possibilities me and a lot of my friends would enjoy it very much
the inconsistency of dark souls gameplay comes from the wonky physics and clumsy movement not from some genius ai my point is that the game feels great because of the things that might go wrong because something didnt happen the way you expected it
thats just not true people love multiplayer and real life opponents are usually not predictable yet that doesnt feel cheap and unfair there are so many games that have a lot of rng in their gameplay and people still love them the whole roguelike genre is based on the desire of people to be surprised the desire to have predictability is there for some people but to claim its an indisputable rule of good game design is just stupid and i hate how so much of western game development has become this strive to find formulas and rules by which games should be designed
 a delay on its inputs would have to be imposed
i think that should be a top priority if designing an ai that uses machine learning to optimize its strategy anyone can write an algorithm that uses the best strategy its much more difficult to build an ai that uses the best strategy a human could feasibly do that requires implementing human restrictions specifically reaction time 
all fighting games are designed entirely around human reaction time so it really miffs me when the ai in them has a response time thats oneonezero of a normal persons
what i mean is that a predictable and static ai is terrible in fighting games because so much of fighting games are actually played in the players heads and not on the screen
youll often hear in fighting game including smash tournaments that a player has gotten the download on their opponent this means that they have figured out their opponents habits and now have a corresponding mental flow chart of what to be ready for in a given situations but downloading your opponent takes time as youll obviously need to play each other for a bit before you can know how they play this is why matches are done best two out of three or three out of five when it gets down to finals its not to account for flukes and luck but to give time for players to one figure out their opponent two condition their opponent into thinking they like to behave one way but then suddenly switching it up and three refigure out the opponents new strategies
against a predictable ai the player only has to do step one which only takes a minute or two it cuts out almost all of the mind games and only focuses on the technical aspect which is just half the battle
ooh that sounds really cool thanks for the link
you dont make adjustments to the ai itself just how it learns also that happened in one game all youd need for all the agents to learn how to deal or better facilitate harassment or distractions is for one of the agents to learn how to do that and the rest will have to learn how to deal with it once they can move to the agents learning fully from their own abilities instead of starting learning thro replays or able to play on battlenet instead of their insulate community theyll end up having even more diverse playstyles
i mean it is not human so as long as it has a virtual keyboard a virtual mouse and only one camera its fair  the big reason it was winning was it was microing the hell out of the human while keeping an awareness of the battlefield
its humans that are lagging behind when they are not able to move that mouse accurately and fast eno
that kind of gimmicky tuning gets called out really quickly and can become painfully obvious to the users
and at the end of the day it still doesnt solve the mass stalker beating immortal problem when a player does everything right to win he should win instead of getting destroyed by an inhuman micro skill
from the players point of view tho this would be no different from a pre codedpredicatable ai since the ai would still have to be disallowed from learning to not pick up the use of bugs
thats what i was mostly thinking that could be done since it can easily be swapped to different training records if the player chooses to change difficulty and if you observe it during the training or monitor the behavior after the training it should be fairly easy to see if any bugs occur with certain scenarios
i think the point of the reinforcement learning in games is to replace all the ai decision trees scripts and automata that drive npcs and enemies with automated training however these agents often discover many unorthodox ways to navigate the game world wall jumping in super mario bros for example other than that the learned behavior might be erratic and way too unpredictable to be any fun for the player
the ai has no scripts or aimbots  it sees the same stuff as you
it just can move it way faster is all
my point is that dark souls bosses have a very rigid rulebased ai which serves the game perfectly if you were to apply machine learning to get a smarter ai it would feel extremely unfair as there would be far too few openings for players to take advantage of
whats better in terms of machine learning task optimization in this case killing the player does not make the game better in fact it often makes the game less fun
people love multiplayer because theyre humans arent capable of dinamically coming up with an infinite number of strategies the excitement comes from all the adjusting to strategies and behaviour that you have to come up with to face an opponent knowing that eventually one will outperform the other
yet that doesnt feel cheap and unfair
actually one of the biggest false reports in multiplayer gaming is for cheating  hacking when its not actually happening
and if i could talk to those people in person i would tell them to grow up and of course theyre not cheating
but if theyre just numbers of customers to me then i would just modify my game so the complaints go down and the sales go up
no one is claiming its indisputable its just play testing consistently finds that to be the case
 people love multiplayer and real life opponents are usually not predictable yet that doesnt feel cheap and unfair
real life opponents are very much predictable people falls into learned pattern all the time you also expect multiplayer opponent to adhere somewhat to the current meta for whatever game youre playing people know camping spots people learn dodge pattern of their lane opponent or jungle routes being able to predict your opponent is a core component of many multiplayer games
but for professional players its much more useful to have an ai that fast as it forces them to be faster as well
the problem is not only in physical restrictions i think but in rational decision making in a strategy game human players might feel attached to or invested in a unit they have been commanding for a longer period of time and this leads them to possibly play more carefully than is good for their strategy
and thats why they solved it in between the matches for a more realistic scenario they want a fair playing field where the ai is superior on a strategic or tactical level instead of brute force ability and before someones mention apm tlos apm spiked higher and more frequently near those heights than what alpha star was doing
they would still be using this tech to develop the ai which is in line with what the survey is asking
aimbots and script see the same thing as you they just react much faster
 if you were to apply machine learning to get a smarter ai it would feel extremely unfair as there would be far too few openings for players to take advantage of
well duh of course if a more powerful opponent that is also smart would be unfair but imagine if your opponent was actually weaker but is smarter than you how fun would that be a really smart ai can make a game really cool if its applied in a clever way also once you have the smart ai then you can place restrictions on it for instance make an ai that is really good at a fighting game like street fighter but whenever a player chooses a lower difficulty give him long reaction time make him have a percent chance to get a move wrong etc there are so many things that can be done with really smart ai just throwing it out of the window because some player like to abuse systems is asinine
and you think that im thinking of an ai that is perfect and will always win thats not what i mean at all
going back to the souls franchise there are tons of people that hate how unforgiving the game is as well the devs however stuck with their vision of the game and they are reaping the benefits right now listening to the players that are bitching the most isnt the best way to develop your game
yeah thats exactly the formulas and rules im talking about get twozero people that are supposed to represent your target audience and listen to them either just theorycraft how theyd feel about a game or get their impression from two hours of gameplay real smart if everyone developed liked that wed have around twozero of the genres we do right now
but not to the level of a standard ai with poor variety of hardcoded behavior thats my point a machine learning created ai will still follow specific patterns because it will reach the conclusion that they give it the best chance to win it wont be completely random and untouchable
 but for professional players its much more useful to have an ai that fast as it forces them to be faster as well
life isnt an anime you cant force yourself to be faster than is physically possible plus i dont think you quite understand how fast were talking about an ai that reacts in one frame onesixseven ms is so much faster than the average human reaction time twozerozero ms that it breaks the game the same strategies cant be employed so its pointless to practice against such an ai 
its pretty widely accepted in every esports community that practicing against the builtin ai makes people worse at the game its more helpful to practice against bad humans than good ai
the problem is that saying such broad things like smarter or dumber cant apply for every ai in every genre of every game
afaik machine learning ai strongest skill is pattern recognition most games that rely on mechanical skill are beaten by us humans recognizing patterns of attack and movement so we can take advantage of them and beat the challenge presented by us take super smash bros for wii u for ex i dont know if this is present in ultimate but the shadow fighters you would sometimes fight against started out dumb and learned from your attack patterns which they dinamically learned to counter so you had to switch it out
eventually who would run out of options first the human or the ai obviously the human unless you started attacking and moving completely at random eventually ai would be able to identify every possible pattern you could come up with and it would be no fun since everything youd do could be countered and you wouldnt be able to recognize the enemies defense pattern 
handicaps are an interesting compromise but it would rely entirely on punishing the enemy only and i can see how that could get frustrating quick if the number of possible patterns to abuse is high
the ai in modern games are basically pretty stupid that does need to be changed and i believe that the majority of players do agree on this point there needs to be more than just creating bullet sponges or large mobs
there are a few good games which actually have nice ai  alien isolation last of us and fear come to mind these ai actually behave differently based on the situation which makes the encounters a lot more challenging these games all had excellent reception with regards to the smart ai
however it becomes a problem when you bring machine learning into the picture theres a huge difference between the reinforcement learning that the op is asking about compared to the standard smart ai that we have seen and are probably talking about
with the smart ai like in the previously mentioned games the devs had to carefully tweak the ai behavior so that they employ some tactics but arent overwhelmingly smart its a very fine balance between a game being challenging and being frustrating especially when player skill varies wildly
with machine learning there is hardly any code to tweak you start with a set of input parameters and the process repeats itself over tens of thousands of iterations slowly improving itself there are two key points that i want to bring up first theres the problem of limiting the ai the trained ai will be very strong and there are no tools where you can tweak it and you cant semitrain an ai because the result might have weird behaviors then theres the problem of the ai improving over the course of the game you need small increments for a noticeable result but this requires uncountable iterations by the end of a normal lengthed campaign the ai would have hardly changed at all if you use larger increments the ai difficulty will jump from a good challenge to just being plain dumb because it will try out different strategies this makes the difficulty inconsistent as you progress 
i guess what im trying to say is that we are looking for carefully fine tuned smart ai which provides a challenge reinforcement learning is probably not the way to approach it because it is a slow process and is very hard to balance
 listening to the players that are bitching the most isnt the best way to develop your game
no but it makes the most money just look at the sales of souls games compared to things like ubisoft games look at league vs dota look at wow vs eq and so on and so forth there is a lot to gain by appealing to the casual crowd
the main issue is figuring out if this is actually the will of the masses or just a vocal minority blowing something out of proportion
there is no need two b sarcastic and rude 
eventually who would run out of options first the human or the ai
if you h
ve a rockpaperscissor system as its usually the case if you often pick rock and the ai picks up on that and starts playing paper often you can switch to scissor once the ai picks up on that you can switch to paper and when the ai picks up on that you havent run out of options you can get back to rock and the ai will lose again if the game is smartly designed you will always have a way to beat the opponent 
also machine learning is a bit slow it needs like onezero times as much practice as regular humans to learn something if we get good ai it wont be one that immediately learns all your weaknesses and exploits them it will be one that has a general good skill at the game that can give a hard time to any experienced player with no learning not to mention that a learning is much more resource intensive than the one that has already learned and is just applied its knowledge there is zero reason to use machine learning like that and what you give as an example in ssb is not machine learning its normal scripting thats hard coded weve had this one for a long time already its not machine learning at all
i already addressed that here
but whenever a player chooses a lower difficulty give him long reaction time make him have a percent chance to get a move wrong etc
openai already had limited apm and reaction time to better match its human opponents so its obviously doable also why do you even need to have the ai learn as it goes along i want to teach it eno to get to a certain level and then only have it apply its skill no need to change it if i wanted vastly different playing styles from the different ai controlled players id just program a bunch of different ai with different goals ive not worked with machine learning but from what i know about it the main thing its programmer does is to set goals well if you have game like starcraft i can make several different ais that all want to win but also have different goals one will have the goal to rush early one will have the goal to get to a maxed army one will have the goal to use a lot of ability units another will have the goal to use normal units one will play bio terran the other mech terran 
i cant believe how ready all of you are to throw away an amazing tech thats right on our frontdoor just because you see one scenario that it might not work very well
not claiming it is machine learning but it is an example of ai recognizing player behaviour
i dont think the rock paper scissors example is really fair for ai most people may recognize a pattern of the other guy chosing rock for example but then how many people do you know are counting how many times have you picked scissors after picking rock or how many times did you switch it up from rock to paper in between rock attempts etc we just dont have the brains or the willpower to do all that in a rock papers scissors game i dont see how you can balance a rock papers scissors ai that doesnt stay too dumb for the human or eventually gets too smart for him without the human randomly switching it up for the sake of throwing off the ai at which point you arent playing anymore
the way i see it competitive multiplayer games are all about counteracting the enemy players actions towards you or exploiting their pattern of behaviour towards your advantage exactly how would we do this fairly with ai at which point does ai stop learning everything you could possibly do if the outcome of a certain play or engagement relies on a randomized handicap for ai is it really fair or indicative of skill and should it be rewarded these are the questions that make me think if we can broadly say dinamic ai or machinelearning is good for every game
i am not knowledgeable in machine learning so i will stand corrected on whatever i claimed regarding it that was wrong
im all for getting better ai in games dont get me wrong i would love to be able to play against smarter ai rather than getting swarmed by mobs or just high stat enemies however as someone who has actually studied and used machine learning i know full well the inner workings of the implementation of it all im only trying to offer some insight about the reasons behind why it hasnt been widely used in games yet im not shutting down any discussion but it is a little annoying when you assume that were just throwing tech out the window its not as simple as that im willing to go into more detail i only ask that you consider the points and hopefully see the challenge in this its not impossible but currently it just takes too much effort
programming is extremely flexible yet its really easy to mess up when it comes to things like this ill try to elaborate on the keypoints a bit more
lets start with reaction time because you brot it up and is also a nice factor to explore ive been following the openai performances quite often whenever they showed up in dotatwo so im also quite familiar with it this quote below is taken straight from the openai blog
weve increased the reaction time of openai five from eightzeroms to twozerozeroms this reaction time is much closer to human level tho we havent seen evidence of changes in gameplay as openai fives strength comes more from teamwork and coordination than reflexes
this statement aligns with my own personal observations and tests in a tactical game like a moba the ai will come up with a strategy where the reaction time doesnt affect their plan too much eg by ambushing which is something that they have demonstrated in their games its pretty cool to see how well the ai adapts to their restrictions last time i gave the ai a ridiculous reaction time of a few seconds just to see what happens turns out that the ai will actually camp out of sight and start prefiring whenever someone gets close they compensated for their handicap by using prediction 
coming back to keypoint one its hard to limit the ai they are designed to be the best of the best we can set restrictions but they will find ways to work around them you will eventually find a set of restrictions which really gives you what you want but the process to get there takes a lot of trial and error 
with machine learning the learning process defies common sense it learns in a different way that we think it should to give a bit of perspective we can look at sethblingsenwikipediaorgwikisethblingneuralnetworks runs it took the ai a full twofour hours to complete the first level of super mario world when he let it try super mario bros after oneseven days the ai was still stuck on the second level unfortunately i couldnt seem to find any videos showing the full training period i did find this videowwwyoutubecomwatchvfvagcetwoumsm to show you how dumb ai actually are during the learning process stopping the learning process halfway at a certain level isnt what you imagine take a look in the video at how the ai first learns to jump over a turtle later on it runs straight into the second turtle despite getting past the first turtle by jumping it doesnt know that youre supposed to jump over all turtles and so it will consistently bulldoze its entire way thro
big disclaimer i understand that they are using genetic algorithms rather than reinforcement learning genetic algorithms take an absurd amount of time to learn however they are good in the sense that you can treat it as a black box application also take note that openai released a paperopenaicomblogevolutionstrategies which gives a good comparison between the two and that genetic algorithms perform very well in more complex situations with easier implementation
i got a little sidetracked there the point again is that there is no midway point when you are training an ai using machine learning for example lets say that we have trained an ai which has climbed its way up to an elo of onetwozerozero in chess this puts it at the level of an average player however a closer look at the games would show you that it doesnt play like an average player it would know an extremely strong opener which would give it the majority of its wins however there would be certain moves that it would not know how to play around it would sometimes completely ignore a threat and let a valuable piece get captured for no reason this is because the ai has not yet fully identified threats and tactics only a portion of them stopping the training at this point would give us an ai which only knows how to do one thing really good and suck at every thing in the end giving it an average rating
machine learning ai is different from traditional ai expert systems in chess traditional ai would be programmed by controlling the ai to look ahead a certain number of moves and to search a certain breadth  depth of the game tree an average chess player may only know how to look ahead onetwo moves and occasionally threefour moves ahead if it is a well learned tactic with this in mind you can easily set restrictions on traditional ai to only look ahead that many steps however with machine learning there is no such order that you can implement because you dont control that aspect of the ai its a basic difference in traditional ai and machine learning ai essentially we tell the ai the location of all the chess pieces on the board and tell the ai that the goal is to win measured by how dominating the win is this is the reason why im saying that it is hard to limit the ai when we use machine learning
all in all i love machine learning because its such an interesting technique and it is definitely the future hopefully this helps in giving a better understanding because i dont really know how much you already understood about it id love to discuss more if you wish
i understand that you are much better learnt in ml than me but that doesnt mean you understand what im saying and much of my points arent rebuked by what you wrote because of that i love discussions as well and i would love to be proven wrong but usually all i meet is a brick wall that seems like its refusing to understand my point on purpose so sorry if i come off as arrogant or something
ok let me try this
in a tactical game like a moba the ai will come up with a strategy where the reaction time doesnt affect their plan too much
yeah but i gave an example of a fighting game i dont actually have a good experience with a traditional fighting game but i spent a good six months playing for honor which is supposed to take most fighting games mechanics and uses them in threed in that game having poor reaction time makes a difference of a night and day i actually stopped playing it because the combination of my geographical location my framerate drops the fact that im playing the pc version on a tv with wireless controllers and me getting close to threezero at the time meant that my reaction time was half as fast as the average good player it wasnt that i didnt know the game well it was just that there were core moves that are easy to use and easy to counter but i couldnt because of my poor reaction time i am certain that you can figure out a way to restrict the ai once its ready to bring it back to a manageable level in any genre the easiest way would it be to have it misfire at random intervals
ex let me take the example of chess you mentioned lets say we train one ai to be godlike nobody can ever beat it and have that ai have a five chance that each move it makes wont be the one it wants to make but rather a one that is just random a really good player will make use of that opening a bit weaker player will need a bit more openings so make that chance onezero you dont change the ai you dont train it up to a certain level you just screw with its connection to the game similar thing can be done in a moba the ai is perfect it organizes amazingly coordinated ambushes but it has onezero chance to want to fire an ability at a precise moment and instead do nothing or fire another ability or point to a wrong target 
and these are just two methods i also gave an example of game specific methods to push the ai in a certain track that can be hard countered by a smart player if he realizes what the ai is doing there are ways and your reply addresses only one of my examples by misrepresenting it 
you will eventually find a set of restrictions which really gives you what you want but the process to get there takes a lot of trial and error
well god forbid we put some work into that lets instead have whole genres that cant produce a single good bot 
stopping the learning process halfway at a certain level isnt what you imagine
no what i said isnt what you imagined i didnt mean lets get it to stop learning before it is too good i meant we shouldnt care how stupid it looks while its learning because once we get it to the level we want it to be as in really good we wont have it learning at all that sentence was made to address the point you and several others always make when i say having machine learning trained ai would be great that the way it learns makes it do stupid things that will be jarring to the players also addresses the point that its really resource intensive but im saying that once the ai is good with the game we dont need to have it learn anymore the restrictions wont come from the point at which we have it stop learning they will come from outside interference and additional goals we set to it 
we tell the ai the location of all the chess pieces on the board and tell the ai that the goal is to win
but we can tell it win using a rook for the check suddenly the ai is having a much harder time
nothing that i know of implements a real and robust model of machine learning to benefit the game id imagine game companies would rather implement simple systems which approximate the feeling of player control rather than use a real ml system it would probably be a massive money and timesink that would never pan out to making a huge difference in the game
if anything tho i can imagine a far future where games in the sim genre city builders etc try to implement simple algorithms to bring more depth but probably nothing too advanced it just doesnt make sense for the product in terms of dev goals imo 
way back in twozerozeroone lionhead studios made the game black and white enwikipediaorgwikiblacktwosixwhitevideogame  where the player is a god who controls villagers and a giant creature  the creature learns thro a form of reinforcement learning controlled by the player the creature ai apparently used a combination of expert system decision trees and simple perceptron neural nets
fun fact long ago before founding deepmind demis hassabis worked at lionhead studios
i think rather than using ml for game ai directly in the short term theres a lot of use for embedding and inference methods to provide richer flags for a handdesigned ai onthefly rebalancing and other such things
imagine having something in a strategy game that just tries to predict the probability that a players next attackexpansionetc will be at some particular point a developer could take that information and build a classic decision tree or fsm style game ai but now with a high level cue in place of low level details
i can also imagine engagement detectors models which weight content dynamically by player preferences etc as fairly straightforward supervised learning problems
in the crudest of senses there are certainly plenty of game ais that change how they act based on the players previous actions as far as having something like a neural network actively training during gameplay thats probably not feasible right now not because itd be too resourceintensive but because current ml algorithms are for the most part extraordinarily sampleintensive  ie you need to provide a lot of data for them to get anywhere that combined with unpredictabilityinstability it could start behaving erratically instead of adapting nicely means the technology is just not ready for that kind of usage
there were some examples in the past but using machine learning for game ai indeed appears to not be very popular i may be wrong here otherwise maybe the most recent techniques just have not arrived in commercial game development yet 
black  white where demis hassabis was lead ai programmer in the beginning made use of quite some machine learning for the creature ai i am not aware of an indepth description of its ai but my source yannakakis  togelius artificial intelligence and games says that the creature ai made use of reinforcement learning there is a decision making model beliefdesireintention and for the implementation of the latter it uses decision trees and simple perceptrons 
the quite complex artificial life game series creatures used neural networks together with a motivation  desires model i see some sources stating that creatures one had seen the first application of neural networks in commercial games 
enwikipediaorgwikicreaturesvideogameseries
im aware of three publications about the artificial life and ai of creatures one which was largely shaped by one person stephen grand

the series is available on gog if you want to give it a try watching the decision making in the neuroscience toolkit or observing internal chemistry are interesting and unique game elements up to today 
the closest i have seen is openai using a reinforcement learning based model to beat dotatwo pros in a very restricted onevone mid match up however it was more similar to alpha go than what you are asking for
what you mention is something i am very interested in but doesnt look like any targeted research is being done there
yeah in terms of effort and economic it doesnt seem like its currently worth the investment
at least not until you can get decent multiplayer practice ai which then could also be placed in single player games imagine a shooter with a large amount of environmental barriers where a reinforcement learning method could help the ai improve every time theyre beaten ideally the human would not be able to win without serious skills or handicap eventually the only winning move is not to play
creatures video game series
creatures is an artificial life alife computer program series created in the midonenineninezeros by english computer scientist steve grand whilst working for the cambridge video games developer millennium interactive gameplay focuses on raising alien creatures known as norns teaching them to survive helping them explore their world defending them against other species and breeding them words can be tat to creatures by a learning computer for verbs or by repeating the name of the object while the creature is looking at it after a creature understands language the player can instruct their creature by typing in instructions which the creature may choose to obey
while in theory this all sounds well and good were talking about game companies going out of their way to hire people who have the background to do this thats a very high expense right now given the demand for people who have this kind of specialization and one they dont need to take
just look at openai if you think of it in terms of will game companies hire a team to experimentally build ai systems the reason this stuff isnt prevalent becomes obvious this stuff needs to get significantly easier and cheaper to implement before its even a glimmer in devs eyes beyond that true ai systems will barely show improvement over hardcoded ai for most games anyway
i think better would be an ai that helped players get better analyzing their play patterns and telling them what they could improve on
generally speaking in games that are not solvable solvable as in like tictactoe or chess youre best bet is to build a hierarchical tree of systems tied to states trying to work toward achieving predefined goals starting on the global scale and then going down the hierarchy diverting work to subsystem depending on current state of the game  
in other words your ai would start each round by checking  
am i in danger  go to a system that deals with preventing defeat
am i safe  go to a system that deals with furthering my chances at achieving victory  
then those systems will look at the state of the game and divert work to further subsystems depending on what needs to be done if ai doesnt have units to defend itself it will let unitbuildingsystem take over with directive to build more units then finally at the very bottom theres a factorymanagingsystem that looks at the current priorities and decides which buildings should start building units  
building the ai as a hierarchy like this is very easy to reason about and breaking the logic into tiny subsystems microservices if you will makes them very easy to move around depending on what needs to be done as in once one microsystem is done another can be queued up to do their work if higherlevel systems decide its good idea to do so
ive build quite a few strategy game ais what you want to do is this have layered systems with each layer providing context for the layers below it
for instance a top layer should evaluate the overall state of a faction and set a strategic stance some stances might be a early game expansion explore the map and prioritize long term decision making b mid game expecting a big war soon collect resources and dont expose yourself c bankrupt and attacked from all sides  hunker down and concentrate on short term survival
a subsystem that controls scouting could then base decisions of off the above a scout far and wide give a high priority to buildingacquiring units for scouting b maybe retain some modest scouting capability if theres unexplored map if its relevant to your game then maybe concentrate on gathering information about potential opponents c no scouting necessary
similarly a system concerned with building improvements can reason a calculate the return on investment over a long period b calculate the roi on a medium period if the site is near an expected front line reduce expected benefit further to account for risk of loss in a war c doesnt contribute to short term survival so dont even think about it
given the above reasoning subsystems can request productionunit allocation and set priorities for their requests production and resource allocation systems can then fill these requests according to priorities
writing an ai is a lot of work as there are many factors to take into account for each decision expect your code to become large and complex when thinking about the ai think about how youd make decisions and what factors youd take into account
dont be afraid to cheat where the player wont notice eg dont write ten thousand lines of code to estimate an enemys overall strength based on unit sightings just examine the game state its such an abstract piece of information the player will never notice similarly the player will notice if the ai doesnt scout but that doesnt mean you cant examine the game map to find nice locations to send your scouts to
if your game has complex diplomacy expect this to be fourzerofivezero of your ai effort and however much time you spend on it expect players to still bitch about it more than anything else

how most fourx games do it
have a bunch of ai advisors each concerned with different aspects of the game economy tech military etc each one recommends a best move and assign it a score given how important the move is
an executive ai then compares the recommendations usually by score and picks one
i have never written an ai for these kinds of games but i have written and studied ais i think the simplest solution is to create a hidden point score for each board state also pick a number of move look aheads the computer considers all moves and scores them then considers all the moves after the first moves and scores them it assumes the opponent human player will pick the best move by score for the human player and will pick its move so that it results in the best board state for the computer after the opponent has moved hopefully i explained that well there are a lot of ways to cull obviously bad move in the decision from being considered and ways to optimize to make it faster if you have rng damage then assume the average or expected damage is given the board state score is likely based on unit count and health tho you can do other score values based on board position attributes like ranged units being close to melee units results in a lower score etc
edit i must confess i misread the post as being turn base strategy meaning a tactics style game not a fourx game other devs have correctly pointed out unless your fourx game is incredibly simple this approach will have too wide of a decision space and the decisions will have consequences too far in the future for this to be a viable approach
gameai prohttpwwwgameaiprocom is a series of books that describe many different ways real games build ai and the books are available online for free
browse thro the collection and look for titles relevant to your game or that people have suggested here
typically a strategy game has too many options to develop a neutral network for it altho im not an expert on nn so i might be wrong
for stellaris we went thro many iterations of ai starting with utility functions every tick we examine the value of all our options then do a weighted random pick of what to do this tick the value was arbitrary decided by the designer based on experience
then we tried an end goal based approach pick an end goal you want to happen check what you need to have it happen then recurse thro each intermediary goal to split them until you get directly actionable items we also had exceptions for emergency situation
this improved the economy quite a bit but not eno for the ai to be competitive with the best humans especially without bonuses
im not sure what was attempted next as i left the project as the new wave of dedicated ai programmers were added
or goal was also more of having the ai be entertaining and have personality than have it be able to destroy human players
dont use ml  games are supposed to be fun not frustrating  ml doesnt give you the ability to tune it eno for games  
id use utility or htn  probably utility
i liked ai and gamess youtube channel for what youre asking look at his total war ai series which has some good info about grand strategy ai
he also has other videos that deal more specifically with particular approaches to ai such as utility ai the subreddit rgameai is also a good if somewhat quiet resource
you might find montecarlo tree search useful random hill climbing
most answers here dont seem to appreciate what kind of game youre making with fourx you need the ai to think several turns ahead not just what to do next turn
for the world layer of my xcomlike i use a kind of goap the key to making it feel smart in a strategy game was tweaking goap to remember its longerterm goals so even as the world state changes each turn its longer term goals persist and most of its shortterm actions lead to those longer goals 
thing is i doubt the player will ever notice this i know it works well because i see its decisions under the hood but players will probably have no idea so my challenge now is communicating to the player that the ai is actually thinking ahead good luck let me know what you go with
you could explore goap there might be some more modern alternatives tho im not too familiar with it
there are some great books articles and websites that will tech you all the different ways and methods of simulating a credible ai opponent
to me its the best part of the whole project very interesting stuff
i chose to go with an htn network for ai for my game and built my own implementation in unity chose it over goap as htn can think ahead where goap solves backwards to reach a goal state i am very happy with it i still use ranked task lists for priority behaviors for roles but having big pool of growing actions has been cool
utility theory ai google it its modular and expandable and can work great for strategy ai with some thotful design and can also be layered from strategic to tactical decision making
dont go down the rabbit hole of a million nested if then special cases utility ai is a better way and im surprised more people arent using it
dijkstra mapsheat mapsas many maps as you can make
the more information and data you can jam in to every inch of the map the easier you can query that for your various ai behaviours and algorithms
forward predictionbrute force like you see in chess is also a strategy that is not usually used by developers even if it can be tremendously useful in some cases
the only unknown is the player themselves for the other ai they are completely deterministic in their decisions and you can exploit that to give some ais an advantage
simulated scenarios between designs and army compositions can give you a threat value as well as give you counters for those designscompositions
heres how i would do it model the ais view of the world as a bunch of inputs to a neural network create a bunch of ais and make them fight against each other for several years at this point it helps if your game can run faster than realtime use a genetic algorithm this is how your own brain evolved ie after each generation take the fivezero best players and randomly combine crossbreed their parameters
test them against real players they will probably be too good so at this point you want to apply some more subtle mutations for a few generations to worsen the ai and produce the various difficulty levels this mutation will also result in some idiosyncrasies that you can leverage to make the gameplay more interesting eg generate a few different ais and randomly select them for each match
i think some games have done it like this but they seem to be in the minority i think the main reason is that its harder to get predictable results or to finetune it when it doesnt do what you want ie how do you reprogram a neural network the best way is probably to tell it what you want if it can be expressed as a function of your games variables and tell it to optimize for that
if this sounds overcomplicated its actually not a lot of code i once wrote a program that evolved worms that raced against each other so it would evolve the fastest moving worms based on twod physics the code was like one hundred lines or something
i loop thro every possible move and give it a score the subscores that are considered grow or shrink based on board state in other words while almost every move considers the will i get killed doing this subscore the is this terrain good for defense
subscore might he ignored near end game when i need the ai to score points
you can find more inspirations from those japanese rts games developed by koei those games are the best designed
i dont want to give magic bonuses to the computer player instead i rather make it as fair as possible  good luck you will need it
whatever you do dont use machine learning or neural networks its the first thing that comes to peoples minds and it has almost no place in game development
dont use ml or nn deepmind have shown that you can use ml to create a strategy game ai but youre not a giant corporation with virtually unlimited computing resources even if it was possible to create a competant ai with modest resources youd still have a lot of problems
change your game rules stats etc ai needs to be retrained which likely takes several weeks
ai will evolve to be good at exploiting bugs and imbalances in the game rather than how you want it to play certainly it isnt naturally going evolve towards being a fun opponent for a player
you have no understanding of how the ai works and no way of tweaking it to prevent or encourage certain behaviours
theres a strong risk that it will evolve to be good at playing itself and totally fall apart against a human opponent who employs different tactics
computers are traditionally very bad at this  it is about understanding a complex environment which our brains have evolved to learn and make an internally understandable complex of rules  laws about  if you look at the history of civlike games the ai has actually got worse over time as the developers decreasingly give a shit because ai quality is a niche interest and cannot be evaluated quickly  the ones with good ai are the ones with game rules made to suit ais and in which the devs have selectively allowed ai cheating that wont spoil the player experience
now that we have made neural networks work good and probably superhuman ais for these games have become a real possibility  i dont think its actually happening yet tho
i havent made a strategy game before but id like to follow the ai wars  civilization model where you are actively informed of the ais choices so that you can adapt intelligently
so while the ai always acts perfectly you get insight on to how to counter them
ive played around with unitys ml agents which uses pytorch and you could probably come up with something decent with a lot less work than coding by hand i think it would be great for marketing and deep learning would tend to have the qualities which make it fun for players its also definitely the future of game ai dev
its a whole different skillset to design and build it tho
 the only advantage the computer will get should be better understanding of the game mechanics
even if you limit the knowledge of the ai to the same as the player the ai also doesnt miss a thing and can instantly calculate all the weak spots in the players defenses on top of that the ai is supposed to be a fun challenge not actually as skilled as the player start simple and iterate on it as you progress in your development ml doesnt allow you to optimize the ai for fun which is the most important part
partial mcts with quick paths for estimating the outcome of actions and aggressive pruning
have you developed a flow chart of roly how youd like it to act
depends on your goals i recommend the goal of making the player feel clever rather than beating the player
if you make the ai too good players just get mad quit and call the game bad id prefer they la at the ai while continuing to play and have fun
given that objective id recommend writing simple ai rather than using machine learning machine learning ai tends to either way overshoot or way undershoot the intended difficulty because you cant exactly train for fun
tommy thompsons youtube videos are a good resource youtubecomcaigamesseries
this is a good comment that quite interesting and a good way to set up the ai from the sounds of it
exactly this youd benefit from some nondeterministic finite automata knowledge as well helps those systems run and transform together in some way bavk and forth
what is a neural network but a vast matrix of precisely tuned ifelse statements
i like to think if i was this bat what kind of behavior would i have to try stay alive and defeat the player
followed by a diagram
followed by hours and hours of staring at a screen trying to figure out how that becomes algorithms on a grid and how that can be put into if statements within if statements
followed by months later me being like oh i dont understand this code better optimise it
leading me to pretty unbrilliant but somewhat legible and working code
honestly tho the worst thing i ever did was invent a pathfinding before discovering someone had already invented it yonks ago and i just wasted weeks coming up with something pretty much the same
so treebased decision i was afraid of that
ah yes the  of ai design
oh that makes a lot of sense
because many fourx games use those exact same ai advisers to give advice to the player filtered tho some extra gameplay mechanics
and the advantage made famous by civ is that you can use the advisors to help teach the player too
hmm that sounds good
yeah i think i understood that was actually helpful thank you   
i will score any state considering everything everything tiles that are discovered unit count even enemy units any command will have to have a predictedcalculated score and ai will generate a few number of command series then choose the best possible outcome is this right   
tho this ai will probably be quite aggressive 
cheers
written and studied ai you say
any suggestions for reading material particularly game applications preferably analogboardtabletop
i do this for a my rtslike board game its a very nice approach also because it allows you to have different difficulties at ease medium difficulty chooses one of the best five moves at random low difficulty never picks the best move and every x rounds depending on how bad the player performs actually picks the literally worst move for itself
you didnt know it but this was the exact solution i was looking for for my own ai troubles 
so thank you 
how did you handle thrashing between options if their if their values are too close
this so many of the answers above focus on making an optimal ai but the goal here isnt to make a chess or gosolver or a labeling machine ml its to make an ai opponent thats fun for a human player
were designing games for humans not for computers  cant risk losing sight of that
also i really doubt the average rgamedev poster has the resources to train a machine learning model to play a board game let a lone a modern strategy video game in fact im not even sure the players computer would be able to run the inference step with the trained model fast eno
yeah goap is what we use in the strategy game i work on
i guess i can try and ask you when i fail 
how not
ml has all sorts of uses in game development 
there has been a few listed in this thread already
it entirely depends on the game
 youre not a giant corporation with virtually unlimited computing resources
going by these other answers i think this point needs to be emphasized a tiny bit more in the original question  
i can just imagine on steam  game  eightzerozeromb added ml files to get the enemy working  fourzerozerogb
big difference between building an ai which plays competently they tend to be terrible so its not a very high bar vs being able to beat world class players
deepmind etc also have the constraint that theyre trying to do it without any parts which dont generalize since after all their goals are not to make game ais being able to design it for your specific game is a big difference
and you can definitely change the way it plays based on different inputs
computers are traditionally very bad at this yet a twofive year old starcraft ai will still beat the majority of the people on this sub p
yes tictactoe and chess are examples of solvable games as they said
its solved technically but not solvable to win only draw the only winning move is not to play
an attempt at mass waveform analysis
my runs at it dont have very many if statements at all just accumulators
from a math point of view it is discrete vs continuous 
that being said the action space is discrete so i guess in that sense they are the same
the real question in how to you insert knowledge into the ai is it expert system hard coded ifthen ai goal oriented action planning or some sort of machine learning
or just cheat that is what most rts do
whats to be afraid of
an rts ai is usually just a priority list of buildingsunits to have attack when army size is sufficient and defend when attacked
your concept of the computer having better understanding of the mechanics isnt a thing its a computer it doesnt understand its not actually thinking
games never really use machine learning youd need hardware you likely cant even come close to affording to train such a model you dont just randomly adjust something whatever that means
use a state machine for clean code still the best way to do ai in my opinion
take a look at thishttpwwwgameaiprocomgameaiprogameaiprochapterzerosixthebehaviortreestarterkitpdf modelling behavior in a tree is not half as scary as you may think it is
and then to enable the computer to almost stand a chance the computer is cheating and is given unfair advantages
while civ is an excellent game one of the best its ai is cheating in just those ways op wanted to avoid
for more on this check the minimax algorithm for looking into the future
and heuristics functions for the point system
i would like to point out that a good point system can be more impactful than looking a couple steps into the future so you can skip the minimax algorithm if you want to
also some actions take multiple turnsminutes
so when giving these a score make sure you take this into account or it will always choose the action that does the most but takes onezeroh to complete
other than that 
if you want your code to stay relatively clean make each action a class with a points function
this way you can customise for each action and even apply preferences for aggressivepassiveeconomist personalities
good luck
generally non abstract strategy games have way too many possible states for this to be a useful approach and you can usually move most or all of your units during a turn often moves will make no sense if considered in isolation but will if considered as a group eg sending a single unit to attack a strong enemy would be a terrible move but sending ten units to attack them would be good move
yes thats it tho giving the ai fog of war will make it tricky but you can control how aggro the enemy ai is by how you score things
yo i am doing a phd in aiplanning and this approach is pretty intractable for the space of four games because the enumeration of future states will paralyze the ai 
go with some finite state automata heuristic stuff based on ufouras comment
my masters was in computer engineering specializing in ai and robotics the only things i can suggest are pretty dense graduate level ai math books that being said artificial intelligence a modern approach by russell and norvig is a great book i have my twond edition copy still but it looks like the fourth is the current edition it covers a lot of ai and chapter five is about games and game ai mind you a lot of games dont need ai as advanced as what they describe and particularly amazing ai is often not fun in games
happy to help
its not exactly how it works since these options are more of a do this now for example build a farm target than a keep doing this for example keep mining ore
or weights are also used to determine a chance percentage of doing something then we pick randomly rx build a farm onezero build a police station one since its a random chance you might so end up building the police station
however the traditional way of avoiding taking is hysteresis a replacement activity had to beat the current activitys weightfive and to stop doing something you its cake had to drop below is thresholdfivefive here is an example value and you should determine value thro testing
easy to add an extra bit of weight to the thing youre currently doing
that depends a lot on the type of ml and the model many of the big name ones have massive numbers of nodes but thats not the only way to do it
we used a non recurrent neural net in a previous game and perf was fine but it was supervised learning and no one spent eno time training it so it didnt work well
base your ai on machine learning if you want to reduce the amount of coding you need do and make a game that is untunable and that players leave negative reviews about how the ai cheats or is astoundingly stupid if you think you have too much hair and want to spend late nights pulling it out while you try to fix individual bugs by additional training runs
fortunately in our case the neural net only drove audio commentary so it wasnt a total disaster
our team released several games using evolutionary computation a form of aiml to allow the ai to literally evolve to defeat the player im not sure how well that would work in this case tho possibly use digital dna to defineparameterize the make up of squads that get sent to attack or defend the most successful squad combos get to reproduce eg if five differently mixed squads  get sent to attack the fittest one the one that does the most damage is the one that the ai makes with variationsmutations in the future continually trying new combinations of the best fit most successful previous squad combos only works if lots of squads are sent so theres signal in the noise
from what ive read they took quite different approaches to the starcraft and go ais one being based interagent competition and selections and the other on game state evaluation and monte carlo methods id be interested to know if you have any specific examples of approaches that game devs can use that deepmind deemed too game specific
 in games that are not solvable like tictactoe or chess
this is stating that these games are not solved but bad sentence structure aside its a good post
im assuming they meant in games that are not solvable like these examples of solvable games tictactoe or chess because tictactoe is definitely solved by any sense of the word there is exactly one right move at any given moment and it is known chess is solvable but not solved a game being solved means that there is an algorithm for determining the outcome of the game from any random position assuming perfect play from both players
tic tac toe isnt like war games 
each network nodes threshold resolution function could be modeled as an ifelse statement
looking into goap i dont want the computer to cheat it breaks all the submersion when the event sends stacks of doom one after another with zero resources
but that is more like agent ai isnt it i need it to think the overall strategy like shall i send onezero units or onesix units to my enemy town shall i attack their gold mines or fields shall i invest in infastructure or military etc
im making a chesslike game and i did something similar to ifelse statements but instead had all possible movesdecisions evaluated on different metrics either booleans or number values then sorted them in priority order it works pretty well and doesnt have to involve as much complexity or specificity as ifelse statements
i often use machine learning in unity i usually only train on a onesixsixzeroti its pretty great and can achieve amazing ai runing fivezero to one hundredzero environments at once depending on complexity you have to know how to train it properly tho i also have done contracts to build nn ai training environments for some game studios ml is definately used in games
games never really use machine learning
i dont think thats what he was saying just that ifelses are a very rigid way of doing it thats what he was replying to and there are more programmatic approaches 
you can build system that lets a designer build a list of weighted desires and have your code evaluate them and make decisions based on those priorities that way you can add new desires without having to figure out where in your giant tree of ifelses it goes 
this is similar to how an npc ai in the sims or similar work they arent a giant nest of ifelses but theyre also not ai
ml is bunk a lot of the time but its possible to train a model on a more powerful machine then run that model on less powerful hardware that said the point of game ai isnt to play the game optimally but to convince the player that theyre playing against an intelligent opponent  that often involves a little smoke and mirrors op should try and consider the experience hes trying to build before investing time in some complicated ai system that might just be too hard for players to beat
actually most gamer pcs do have the necessary hardware thats the gpu plus it doesnt have to be a complex model even a simple model might be trained   
that said this might be teoretically possible but i too am curious if any game actually used to train their ai
meh ive used idthree cfourfive cart etc as well as evolving knns
sure not the fancy stuff someone thinks of when machine learning is said but theyre all riding on the same bus
it depends on the ml system i wrote a simple one for a digital ccg i made and it required little training
yes but thats not particularly relevant to the multi agent approach itself
you can also create different feelings for the ai by having it change scoring mechanisms after a few turns or after different player interactions sometimes very aggro sometimes more passive depends on the game and how you want to do it
fog of war can probably be something like
a list with all seen units and their last know position
maybe even how long ago they were there 
addupdate a unit if its within visible range
remove when it dies while in range or after going x turns unseen
the is in range calculation should stay the same as for the player the ai and player should be derived from the same base class after all
yeah i thot about it because the fog of war is a thing in the game but small steps
i agree when i read turn based strategy i thot of a tactics style game but coming back to this thread i see its a fourx civ style game hopefully he gets good advice from other people as well in the thread
that being said artificial intelligence a modern approach by russell and norvig
i knew reading the first sentence in your reply this was going to be mentioned this was my threerd year ai textbook in twozerozeroseven
thats still a lot of development time poured into a preset strategy peragent its still a computercentric design approach so not very scalable timewise and not working from the pov of shaping the human players experience
if folks want to have fun building ml agents as a side project thats fine but it doesnt really serve the purpose of a game ai opponent which is to make the human player learnmaster the game and potentially feel something smart accomplished challenged maybe even frustrated
you can train the ml to maximize fun too like for example you try to prioritize game state that offer non obvious flashy plays to the player or win but not too much
for example their agent needs to build buildings and manage the build order while also knowing how to build and micro units and their abilities some versions even had to manage the camera view like a player simply splitting it up into separate networks for each part would make the problem an order of magnitude easier
the agent was fed roly  the same visual input the player receives whereas an ai for the game can just pull the game state directly and skip the visual interpretation 
it also had to send commands like a player ” by clicking etc which was rate constrained
and most importantly it has no way of evaluating the game state whether it was doing well or not except by reviewing all its previously seen game states and the winloss outcomes this means it required a huge amount of past experiences a regular ai can easily calculate this for every turn instead
i realize that and im saying that tic tac toe is a so
ved game that means that there is a correct play you can make every single time with full confidence chess is not a solved game
you could say this about literally anything
you may be right but accumulators are much more efficient you can use them for error analysis at the end where branches are in fact useful
sins of a solar empire like many cheats as a multiplayer 
but ya it does make ai feel totally different from pvp its no longer about winning a edge thru counter play and resource loss but instead about cheesing and getting them to walk into kill boxes
removed
if you want to see how advanced ai strategy can get with nothing but ifelse statements every lua script used in civ vi is sitting there in the game folder definitely good eno for the biggest 
the below is practice for thinking this way for myself no idea if useful to you tbh
like shall i send onezero units or onesix units to my enemy town
divide my total money by lowestcost thing eight make x techd to mob x eight every two minutes  
research new tech for main class every twothree minutes   
scout for information every eight mins minutes  
add erach of these to a stack of things to do see what needs changing 
shall i attack their gold mines or fields
then i feel like
main class randint three water air land
attack randint onethree  water air land x one hundred  round to onezero drop lowest function drop lowest of three fivezero of time proceed with other percents 
now youre researching seemingly not random things and strategically attacking other things with purpose
so anyway if youre developing a two player rts you can manage with slightly fewer resources than deepmind otoh if youre developing a fourx ai youll also have to deal with multiple opponents diplomacy and random maps not sure if they ever upgraded the starcraft ai to handle those which will easily offset any savings you make by having direct access to game state
if zero then zero else one end if
a follow up to this creating a little randomness isnt bad either you can increase the bounds of the randomness too
so you could sort the decision tree in a way where the cases checked first are the most impactful removing rangedelite units capturing territory etc
then roll die before you traverse the tree and bypass different gates based on the die roll and difficulty level is easy could bypass the elite unit gate half the time on easy twofive of the time on medium and zero on hard 
when choosing unit numbers have the optimal number of units be calculated in some way and then generate a range with bounds based on difficulty
can even use dynamic programming to generate the ifelse in a semirandom order for tiers of moves to create some more texture
so thats why civ ai is always disappointing in a way
wait can you access the source code of civ or just the older games
ive done ai for a racing game a simulation sims like twod fighter like mortal kombat boardgame ai and a fps for bots of different difficulty it is definitely more suited for advanced ai if you just have a gomba like from super mario it is wayyy over kill since programing a fsm or simple ai is faster the more complex the ai the better ml is as a solution i have also used ml to play a game instead of having one hundredzero testers the ml was able to identify bugs in the games i would have needed many play testers to do
currently using it for mundus evello teaching our ai to fly thro space and build its own empire pretty fun but lots of tweaks it does ignore some mechanics but we have lore in place for that
goodluck it is a great tool the hardest part is thinking how a computer needs to learn and the  setting up an environment that teaches it what you want and not something else haha  i stared with a project that used ml for a lot i posted on twitter and my project was purchased by another company ive since done oneseven contracts a few were just related to dots tho  ml was a very untapped market
yes the ml agents unity package hosted on github  it links there from that page
unitys github hosts everything here   githubcomunitytechnologiesmlagents
youre severely underestimating the cost of the general part of agi but were getting off topic
well civ is also a pretty complex game with a massive decision tree they need to balance that with the fact that players expect to have minimal loading time between turns
if you have it on your computer its just in your games folder then assets and then basically every sub folder be warned tho theyre all dozens of kilobytes large
do you have any tutorials if not you should
thats interesting how does your ai figure out something is a bug i get that it can detect errors but often bugs are things that are technically not wrong but just unintended for example if you get killed by a giant and get launched into the air it can still technically follow the games rules of physics tho its not supposed to happen
the future is now old man
ive made a small turn based game where the ai each turn one makes a list of all possible actions for all its units two assigns each order a score based on various weights and modifiers three executes the order with the highest score and four repeats steps onethree until no more actions can be taken
could i use this toolkit to find better numbers to put in as weightsmodifiers
i know very little about machine learning but i imagine it should be possible to change either one or several numbers let the ai play a number of games against itself and see how the changes affect the ratio of wins to losses
i do not  maybe i should think about making some tho i thot about streaming ml on twitch but wasnt sure ppl would watch haha i also do contracts for ml ai development and training curriculums 
 like the other user said it learns to play the game it may have fivezero or more instances of the game running at the same time it will not flag a bug but i can look thro data visualizations and identify if the ml accessed parts of the map that were not intended had too much of a stat never made it past a certain stage etc
i assume he doesnt mean it literally identifies things as bugs  more like it reveals bugs  instead of hiring play testers to rigorously try out all sort of things you just have the ai play a bajillion games and you may find that theres a hole in the map or that physics is weird if the wheel gets stuck on the side of a barrier or whatever
absolutely you just need to tell it the possible actions it may surprise you and figure out a better way to play the game than you intended i have done some work in ml for board game ai and often the ml can become almost unbeatable if you train it too long and too well haha it is very effective for that type of ai using reinforcement and imitation learning to get the ai moving and thda to gail learning will pit the ai against each other wherein the ai will not want to loose to another ai
if its a game in which more than one player unit moves civfive wesnoth xcom ” not chess this approach doesnt naturally identify good combinations of moves 
have you looked at evaluating and ranking board states ie the chess approach
please do
twitch i would watch please enable vod replays tho
youtube would be even better by please do
a youtube channel is probably better so people can do it on demand let me know if you decide to set something up
one would watch please let me know if you do this
please do i would watch everything you put out a good channel on ai is exactly what i have been looking for
ok thanks this is useful input with tell it the possible actions do you mean the weights it is to modify orders are simple and carried out by the units without involvement of the ai
eg a possible order might be attack unit x in tile y and its score will be the base weight for the order type in this case the type is attack unit modified by things like expected outcome ratio of dealtreceived damage and distance
theres no coordination between units or optimization going on the ai is just a greedy algorithm that scores all orders picks the one with the highest score and repeats
i understand i might not get great results with this approach but im still curious how much better it could be with just better weights and modifiers
i see it straightforward when we got board game without randomness but what if board game is pretty random is it ok that every agent in every epoch get different random seed im afraid that could be too difficult for them or should they use the same conditions for some time im afraid that could skew ai into one of solutions
i know i havent looked at ranking board states but i have looked at using optimization decided that the current solution was good eno tho as its only ment to be a small demo if i ever expand on it i might look into the chess approach
you dont need the smaller units be a part of the ml you can just have the ml decide the best orders to give out based on the result the units in battes and the battles etc the ml will learn which it the most effective orders in almost any situation and assign them to your other units that have standard scripts  
yeah ml is great for being ai in  boardgames with elements of randomness where decisions still need to be made because it learns  to do what will more give it the best possible outcomes when decisions need to be made if the game is like snakes and ladders tho where it is completely based on luck and no decisions at all then the ai might as well just be programmed
thanks when thinking about this again i think i just wanted to take a shortcut if i get to actually trying this i might as well do it properly
but i guess the problem would then be how to adjust difficulty like you said ml might make the difficulty too hard and not fun for the average player
pretty sure the citcon demo showed people talking or at least pretending to have a convo
but either way a good point it does make a difference
so i was listening to number of videos and presentations on scs ai subsumption including some more recent ones concerning the developers progress in programming the ai to interact with objects in the world and it occurred to me that they never once mentioned ai social units and how it would affect object interaction  in almost any photographed instance of a public park or gathering area there are always either an even number or greater number of social units vs individuals going about daily tasks  even during a work day and in areas where there are little to no tourists  it seems like such a small thing but in reality it has a huge impact on the lifelikeness of the ai in sc  i wanted to create this thread to put this out there for discussion and to invite anyone who may have heard something like this come out of the dev team to share what they know  i really believe in sc and what i have heard about ai subsumption is truly incredible i just hope that even in the early stages that there is some discussion on this topic  i think this sort of thing could really bring the world of sc so much closer to feeling like the ai are part of a living breathing universe  
one recent game in particular that understands and addresses this better than any game ive played is planet coaster wwwyoutubecomwatchvgktkehnqgkg
yup very good point but i think this is the intention they have been putting a lot of work into npc animations and making sure they can do things like all sit down at a table together
if they have not considered this you are correct and it should be done
all cig has to do is have each person using their mobiglass then itll look exactly like real life where people walk around interacting with their smartphone and avoiding any possibility of accidentally socializing with another human being 
good observation  here have an upvote
ai is coded by engineers tho most of em dont really go outside d
ill believe it when i dont believe it
it doesnt have to mean anything years ago i programmed a function to simulate fluff npc population for an add server nwnonetwo for those who know the acronyms the idea was to have them act similar to the npcs in oblivion i think
it basically worked by placing down waypoints denoting places of interest that the npcs would walk to once close eno to the waypoint the npc would look at all objects within a set distance pick one randomly and start interacting with it  that is play some animation so they sat on chairs hammered on an anvil and so on
if the object picked randomly was another npc they started interacting with them this worked pretty well altho i quickly turned off the start a real conversation with the other npc because any place with a decent amount of npcs was so filled with chatter that you could not see the players talk any more 
but the point is you dont need to define social groups in fact it becomes more dynamic if you dont as random npcs can interact with each other  provided you programmed an appropriate routine and there is an animation for it
i think cig should take a look on how planet coaster handles ai groups it would be neat serving with an ai crew with an ai captain
gta five does it pretty well weve barely seen ai in sc yet 
didnt chris mention that they were working on crowd simulation in the citizencon presentation 
obviously it can do better its not even close to done sc subsumption is still in the very early stages
while op is not wrong this is like pointing at a halfbuilt car and saying hey this could be a lot better with some wheels and an engine no shit it just hasnt been added yet we already know cig is working on stuff like this dont you remember for example the mess hall tests
its a bit condescending to say that cig doesnt understand game ai concepts like this simply because they arent implemented in a very early version of the system
whats interesting particularly about group actors in sc is how simple it is to create a group groups are naturally formed around ships because thats how people get places so its a good assumption that most of the crew is friendly toward each other to a point have these groups work together by following their leader and there you go
subsumption isnt ai subsumption is the mission generation engine that allows for both direct and procedurally generated content i thot
as a logical extension of this ive often said in the past that we need group emotes like handshake high five hug etc
first person initiates the remote by typing handshake for instance  and they animated putting their hand out
second person nearby can just leave them hanging or also type handshake at which point the animation system takes over both player models and plays the handshake emote
that may be why the first assassins creed was so ground breaking in town many ai move in groups sit on benches together move in groups it made the world feel alive 
better ai is good but this subsumption word is tiring to hear
lotta talk and its a big walk  i want this to be  but they started talking about this three years ago  godspeed on the tech but im very skeptical on this and like everything else its sevenzero talk right now and no show on the other threezero
go go test servers  cig is working in a huge vacuum of progress  but the money is in the evocoti right now  threezero is the tipping point
its been a fucking year for the update that was just at worst three months out  yea i remember  
edit the true true gets me down votes it seems  kids ive been here from twozeroonetwo   blow me as i call it as i see it  and its still sixk well invested but goddamn this has been a shitshow sometimes
i dont know why but i have a feeling that sc will use alexa amazon echo for subsumption ai 
assassin creed has had groups of ai interacting since the days of altair i think what makes good ai is them simply not doing dumb shit that pulls you out of the game
be fun if they used conversations from sections of the forums then use text to speech ship chat and the like
how subsumption works actually makes this a bit to to do in the old says a simple convo between two npcs just had to be scripted if you wanted to make it realistic you would just follow their actions for five mins or so with small bits of banter or take the mass effect approach im sure many others do this and create small story arcs that the two npcs can follow and talk about 
now with subsumption all of these npcs have daily lives they leave their residence move to their job post whatever entails in their daily life now you start factoring in things like living and so on till it basically becomes a sims game now im not saying this cant be done but slipping in random meetings with scripted conversations with procedurally generated worlds and cities is going to be a massive undertaking 
were talking about being able to have an ai literally generate a conversation thats more or less random that falls in along parameters of being relevant to where they are and what time 
its talk  wishes and hopes i desperatly want it to be true  but they have been talking about this  for the last three years and jack all of shit is realized so it is what it is on that front  
we shall see i hope ai is like the procgen planets  but none of it is in game  and its only been a year from when they thot it was  going to be ready
the meme should instead be how games are launched and why sc is still in alpha after seven years
i think this grouping idea is one one of the reasons people liked games such as earlier mass effects so much that you could stop and listen to a group of people just talking about something  maybe it interested you or maybe u just walk off but there was something unexpected going on frequently
the problem of course is the sheer volume of dialog that need to be written and voiceacted to avoid repetition its a lot of work and if youre adding in the ability for characters to walk around or physically interact or significantly react with objects or each other that introduced a shit load of bug testing
i love it i hope theyve already considered this or see this and consider it
one game where i feel this was done well is watch dogs two  i would run around sf and constantly bump into groups of characters hanging out dancing talking etc  when you interacted with them sometimes they would react as a group or react individually  it felt pretty good  that game may not be the best example but having ai interact like that would definitely make the sc world feel alive
id also like to add some of the things the early assassins creed games did not so sure about latter ones crowds have physics essentially and you have to push them aside to get past them thus far weve seen npcs walk right thro each other in all the atvs and demos
im really impressed however that they managed to put so many npcs in this demo without significant performance drops
its alot of talk and we are far far away from this  dont get your hopes up
this was never a question of which one results in better ai this is a question of economics
check out assassins creed origins for great subsumption
sc ai has a long road ahead
please yes the npcs can talk about work related stuff like johnny are you done with your break yet another ship came in and we have been paid to get this done asap this customer brot in an eightninezero jump johnny hell yeah lets see it
the conversations dont have to be about mud crabs lol
for what its worth i remember seeing nicely done crowds in assassins creed unity 
never even thot about that but you are one hundred correct
were born alone and we die alone
another one is mood a lot of people in a blade runner setting should be feeling miserable a little scared
yeah frontier did groupingfamily in planet coaster done really well they could easily bring it over to elite sc should be doing more
true but id say that level of detail is probably a few steps down the road from where were at right now
gotta get all those cafeteria animations done first ya know
metal gear solid tpp did this really well you could listen to soldiers talk from a hiding spot and if they were alone odds are you can listen in on their comms
assassins creed 
a very fair piece of feedback good yob
hmm how about a natural sounding texttospeech voice for the frontend developed by cig ofc and for the backend you could use some random neural network cleverbot can hold a good conversation with itself sometimes 
yakuza zero does this really well often you will see couples or groups of people hanging out and it looks really natural
the witcher three has some of the best feeling towns and ai in my experience i suspect because of group so interaction and flipping great conversations swearing included im rather positive that they used murmur sound within larger cities too
for me the key for live feeling ai is when they get into conflicts with each other independent of your activity
good point but they said this is just the first iteration of the ai i think it will get better the ai will need to work in groups and with the player to complete tasks in bigger ships
yeap upvote and cig please
i would argue that it is a combination of group actors and repitition that image on the right will never be recreated you will never have that same moment occur again the reason why ai feels stale in games is actually variation 
i dont really care about npcs maybe the first time i land somewhere it gives the place more life after the one hundredther time doing the one hundredth mission  quest i dont care neither for the npcs nor for the fancy graphics  its all just a backdrop
sure eye candy is nice but once you play a game and repeatedly are in one area it becomes mundane so if they can do with the npcs what they did in wow have them just standing next to each other or sittingwalking around in scripted manners that is absolutely eno for me i dont even need them to have audio or do any elaborate animations during conversation
doubt they are going this route as this presents its own set of issues
their crowd simulation may be something different entirely
you know developed by them
destiny two has group npcs that have conversations with one another so theres no reason star citizen cant work that into subsumption im just curious how they plan to have a universe of npcs with interactions on a scale they have without melting cpus
hey cig we ok without having groups of ai
thanks 
everyone
they can simply use the atv burndown conversationsincredibly realistic and boringinteresting depending on your viewpoint for npcs to regurgitate 
imo the citizencon demo shows just how much work they have to do go watch it again  people arent sitting down standing on benches some npcs are just randomly standing in a t formation  it was seriously buggy and that was with one person running thro as a demo not me exploring  pretty sloppy  i expected them to be further along personally 
the city terrain looks beautiful but so far i have seen nothing revolutionary about ai in this game and they have been talking about it for years right its a major blocker for the game to progress so i would have thot it would be in better shape 
i pretend to have convos all the time does that mean i am ai now
just have your generic texttovoice software reading conversations found on rsubredditsimulator
if needs driven economic design for what drives the universe goes the direction theyve talked about  where companiesnpcsplayers will have a needwant and what they do drives their decisions with what they wear eat and where they go then its entirely possible subsumption ai will take its queues from those needs and automatically become more naturally socioeconomic
if my thinking is close only two ingredients would need to be added to subsumption ai constant need for pleasure wanting to experience happiness fun drama etc  a closely related inherent personality which of those pleasures does an npc crave most a type personality b type sociopath etc
one  if each npc has their own actual personality  personal hobbypleasure then subai along with a well implemented needswants driven economy will cause npcs to be more natural where some are grouped up friendsacquaintances and others might be going about their business or just wanting to be alone
two  implement npc ai w needsdesires and the game economy will drive them to work when needed or pirate but take breaks and chill when ableneeded withwithout friends depending on the circumstances
they never once mentioned ai social units
i could be wrong of course but i also noticed this and have always assumed there was a very good reason for it and that was that they were working on it and werent ready to show it
in theory social units should require almost the same resources as individuals a sloppy mistake would be to just have multiple individual actors that stick together instead social units should act as a single actor that act and react together while this sounds shitty on paper it makes it possible to simulate even large crowds relatively easily
this just needs dynamic creation and splitting of groups eg mom is too scared to ride the rollercoaster and waits on the park bank 
fantastic example absolutely what i am talking about  the ai in that game is clearly extremely basic and very efficient judging by the quantity of data points  forming ai behavior should be partially based on group interaction to achieve more lifelike crowds in populated areas  in addition i would argue that this approach to ai offers more benefits than focusing on individual interactions as even simple group behaviors like moving in a group more simulates lifelike behavior than the actions of individuals  
reminds me of stuff like this from this years siggraph
contextaware motion prediction for crowd simulationyoutubewpprizthreeninewqk 
thats very unrealistic from my standpoint not a single person tried to cluelessly walk down a blocked path only to get there and have to turn around
source me url
that video was no fun no one got crushed or died by roller coasters 
the soundtrack is what sold that game to me lol so amazing
i was once like you then i took an arrow in the knee
or some dude named dervin in witcher three
guild wars two is the same
elder srolls online did a pretty good job about this not many but unique to those npcs
yeah thats the video i saw  what bothered me is they only discussed developing more interactions with objects and with objects parented to objects but there was never any mention of planning to make  some of those interactions dependent on the presence of other ai  for example if two seats close together or opposite eachother at a table are occupied by ai chatanimationtrue is activated or something like that  that level of interaction would create a more believable background ai  
thank you for that tho there are only three interactions i can see in that example that are clearly meant to look like a group interaction  many of them are just individual actions with actors placed in close proximity  i am suggesting a deeper philosophy of creating actions based on social interaction  this is also from so long ago why hasnt this been shown in the latest examples of scripted ai  that worries me more  
clever
i like that 
an add server nwnonetwo for those who know the acronyms
uses more acronyms to explain other acronyms  
i know what they mean but still i had to la
iimgurcomdpqnineyjlpng
neverwinter nights was based on threerd edition rules
your server sounds awesome by the way and im sorry i have to ruin everything i touch with pedantry
nwn was so amazing absolutely enjoyed that game and nwntwo  one of the most fun coop rpgs ever created imho  i forgot how much modding there was that was a lot of fun 
id be down for playing thro the game with people again just for nostalgia  i really enjoyed the coop aspect relying on each other to tackle combat traps etc  
two videos for this game mentioned so far in this discussion who would  have guessed something like planet coaster would have elements we would want to influence star citizen
right but it was ambiguous with the details just one sentence in passing we have no idea how they intend to implement
yeah thats to fill the streets with random npcs walking around to help cities feel livedin 
my thots exactly
while op is not wrong this is like pointing at a halfbuilt car and saying hey this could be a lot better with some wheels and an engine no shit it just hasnt been added yet 
spot on 
its both
ai subsumption is essentially the god ai for star citizen 
it controls the entire npc population and is supposed to generate missions based on their needs
it also does ai activities such as going tofrom work getting food going to sleep etc 
i hope its also going to be used for fauna to give animals more realistic lifecycles 
subsumption is the ai director as a results it covers a lot of things ranging from generic npc behavior to procedural missions and more
the assassins creed ai is infamously stupid tho
meme is buthurt haters make the best salt
exactly tons of games of have group interaction ai except they interact in the same spot for all time swtor comes to mind 
i dont really understand your comment  from everything chris roberts and the dev team has said they are already spending a great deal of effort on ai subsumption with a stated plan of having twozero million npcs operating simultaneously at any given moment in the final iteration that each have individual schedules and meaningful interactions  my post is to point out that in all these efforts to make ai more lifelike that they do not overlook the importance of social interaction  i would hate for their efforts to be in vain due to such a simple oversight  not that i would suggest that they havent at least discussed this internally once  
id rather have mute citizens or mumbled inaudible conversations than dynamic npc chatter like tes oblivion had
hi i saw a mudcrab the other day disgusting creatures
ive heard others say the same
any news from the other provinces
nothing id care to talk about
im no expert on the subject of gaming ai but i will throw out some assumptions for fun of the conversation amongst real people 
ai typically pulls from a stack of pre recorded dialogues in games like gta the ai will initiate a conversation when it comes into contact within another ais conversation zone at which point they will face each other in conversation animation then they will pull from their flow chart of possible statements a beginner or conversation opener depending on the random opener the conversation will proceed thro a series of flow charts with dialogue that roly makes sense in gta this is obviously fairly simple someone says something wierd  therefore the response is what your crazy pretty simple 
in star citizen from what i have read and seen they want to have ai with a purpose this differs from gta in that the characters are randomly generated and pop in and out of existence in sc they will have schedules that they follow even when they dont physically exist games like skyrim have ai like this they are at home asleep at night and doing their job during the day based on a schedule new waypoints generate at certain times of course skyrims dialogue doesnt change based on the time of day leading to some awkward bedside conversations 
i would assume that sc will have a similar timed waypoint system with random flow chart based conversations hopefully better than gta possibly they could incorporate time of day conversation charts so im not waking someone up to have a conversation about ship sales at astro armada
well consider this you get closer to get an eavesdrop start enjoying the chat then it stops you turn your head just to meet the gaze of the two npc you were listening to they stay silent and look at you hey weirdo why dont you go stalking someone else
top immersion
theyve made some mention of the number of wildlines for sqfourtwowwwyoutubecomwatchvzerobzeroqufscugofeatureyoutubetoneonemthreeones more herewwwyoutubecomwatchvmgxgrplfiveaeeightfeatureyoutubetfivesevenmtwosixs too this is obviously sqfourtwo content but im sure itll have the same kind of treatment 
maybe community involvement could solve this ask the community to write and voice conversations and submit for evaluation there have been several mod projects that took this approach and could work really well for sc 
the bonus here would be that the community would have a direct impact on the verse
something like radiant ai would be great so you can gain new missions and or info by eavesdropping
having that much content over the entire population would definitely be difficult to achieve but i think to a certain extent they might have some built in script to pull from as the game progresses as events happen story archs get written and new content is created 
i dont know that it would be that much of a stretch to generate some scripts for npcs talking about the latest xian attack that was covered on the news yesterday
something absolutely genius they could do is pull vocals from podcasts and such run it thro an ai to reconstruct the facial features then set it on a template the vocals could run off of a server si that updating it doesnt require patching the game just use the same template for different vocals minus the facial features when loading into an instance the voice track loads too
fingers crossed for oblivion dialogue 
well the voice adjustment tech it would entail would be a cool thing to develop  could probably be toggled on for players as well to help with immersion for people playing genders or ages that dont match their pitch etc
 its a major blocker for the game to progress so i would have thot it would be in better shape
thats odd the fact that it is such a huge blocker and such a to thing to do at that scale seems like a good reason for why its not terribly far along 
oblivion does this and required npcs could just randomly get murdered
at what point are we dealing with a digital westworld where it is immoral to switch off the server
its pretty abstract how wanting to experience happiness fun drama etc leads to fivezero of people walking and talking you have to actually tweak your plans for the enjoyment of good company grouping i feel needs a human touch
so when your mom in sc sees me she can split off of your ship and come back to my place for my ship  Í¡ ÍÊ– Í¡
now if only the vanilla characters could use lanes properly
hurray for mods
i love my city in cities skylines but my traffic sucks  i often find myself demolishing whole neighborhoods just to put in better streetsand suddenly i understand my states department of transportations motives  lol  
is the reason youll be on board of an idris maybe later on a bengal and people inside ships especialy in the military are constantly interacting with objects or going to
it shouldnt have you worried its early and they intend to do it chris even talked about crowd simulation 
ahh not ai in that it flies ships and such but more universe ai or virtual citizens  gotcha
my point was ai groups alone doesnt make it anymore convincing
from everything chris roberts and the dev team has said they are already spending a great deal of effort on ai subsumption with a stated plan of having twozero million npcs operating simultaneously at any given moment in the final iteration that each have individual schedules and meaningful interactions
this is an interesting topic and i dont know a great deal about ai and how it works but from everything ive read they arent going to have twozero million discrete entities all going about their business but create and stream them in as necessary around players based on the statistics generated by the background economic simulation as well as algorithms that look at the players group and missions 
in other words the system isnt deterministic but creates whats needed on the fly  cr called it the background crowd simulation and said certain important ai like mission givers would persist and have a full schedule 
oh i dont need wandering packs of ai   you ever look in the eyes of ai black eyes like a dolls eyes then they start biting and they roooooollover white
i had this exact conversation with my friend the other day amazing
yup the immersion breaks as soon as you hear a repeated conversation or line 
hey it worked for mass effect
clearly cig should just solve one of the largest outstanding problems in computer science s
i think mumbled inaudible conversations would be the best bet since we cant actually know what theyre saying we cant exactly get fatigue from hearing the same thing all the time
you say that but go try playing bdo there is like onetwo npcs at most they are just stood around and yet they have this sound effect playing of a what sounds like a busy street with a ton of conversations just randomly place sound too it doesnt even translate to where npcs are
or dishonored 
do you think youll get your own squad after what happened last night
indeed i believe so
true but then theres the deus ex games which do this really well
something something cloud imperium district
i wonder if there is some way for the game to track the quotes conversation heard and reduce frequent topics based on audible exposure and when it was last heard no i dont want a sweet roll stop asking
should we gather for whiskey and cigars tonight
agreed too much of that shit and i manage to play games with the sound muted while watching netflix
i hear the nords in skyrim have seen any elves lately
goodbye
hello for the king for the peace of the kingdom for king and country for the kingyoutubecpnineseteightxjsixg
id rather have mute citizens or mumbled inaudible conversations
or conversations in xian so that it feels less repetitive because we dont really understand whats being said
i would want it this way as well when walking down the street i tune out all the voices anyway and it just becomes city noise id rather them focus on voice content resources where it counts  
altho that would give a meaning to the xian banu and vanduul having full fledged languages
good point  however one would think that with the projects developmental timeline along with the vast amount of funding theyve received so far that they would be able to create npc dialogue that is both immersive and adaptive
i used to be an adventurer once until i took a blaster shot to the knee
i agree  mumbling stuff to each other is far preferable
me on a date youtubewmsixfpvcovceight
shall we meet for whiskey and cigars tonight
in star citizen from what i have read and seen they want to have ai with a purpose this differs from gta in that the characters are randomly generated and pop in and out of existence in sc they will have schedules that they follow even when they dont physically exist
actually from everything i have read it sounds like sc is using a combination of both the majority of npcs will be radonmly generated on the fly what cr was calling their background crowd simulation for landing zones based on the high level economic simulation your location your ship types and numbers in the case of generated enemies in space and missions you might have some npcs like mission givers will persist and follow and schedule
edit so hard to find any sources these days but i found one that is relevant
onezeroftc episode seveneight question twohttpscqainfoshowonezeroftcepisodeseveneightqidtwo
so whats going to happen is that we have a universe simulation that runs on a separate server thats much more of a big picture simulation think of it kind of like a civilization game or something like that sort of a slower turn based game that actually is simulating the universe what all the npcs are doing on a macro basis whos trading with what whats producing what what goods are needed where where pirates are attacking the sort of general outcomes of those results are all happening on the universe simulation and its own process then that is getting trickled down to the local game servers that all the players ie you guys are attaching to and playing in the snapshot of whats happening on the universe server is sort of carried across the game server
what would happen is for instance if you were down on a planet it would say okay well this planet is a mining planet and you know so ill generate and the population is this size therefore well probably populate the landing area with x number of npcs sixzero of them will be miners and then well have some law enforcement and you know well have some service workers in the bars and stuff like that it will all be generated by the data thats pulled down or pushed down from the universe server so it will dynamically change
oblivion absolutely nailed this
greetings
get away from me breton trash
have you heard any news from the other provinces
i ran across a goblin the other day horrible creatures
ive heard others say the same
stop talking
conversation is seemingly over npcs stare at another for four seconds then initiate conversation once again
hail argonian
if you want full immersion you should test this out in real life too for science and research purposes of course
so hearing something like boredgamers tricksy little hobbitses phrase from his twitch stream every so often i would la quite a bit 
except they have been talking about how its a major blocker for over a year now since before the last citizen con yet the ai still doesnt recognize that you sit not stand on chairs 
not talking about revolutionary tech here im also speaking as someone that really wants the game to succeed and just giving my honest opinion  i expected ai to be in better shape at this point also if something is holding your game up shouldnt that be your priority again it was cig that said it was the holdup not me 
seems to be a problem in every city simulation game they all try to plug down the same street while ignoring the side streets
wow that is incredible thank you for sharing
think of it as the brain of the game it handles creation of dynamic missions cargo quantities and market prices npc movement random encounters etc  
and its doing this stuff based on a reaction to other stuff so i think the idea is if a single player was traveling from a to b there might be a small chance of random encounter single pirate interdiction or something but if a group of players is going from a to b itll adjust the weight of the encounter  
maybe someone corners the market on fuel in xyz system which increases prices and generates fuel transport missions in nearby systems  stuff like that
yeah that does seem to make sense tho it wasnt clear to me if they meant ai would be doing things like taking missions and trading which would be meaningful interaction  i thot thats what he meant which would be beyond special npcs that give missions  i think there should definitely be a video done or something discussing this on around the verse or something i would love to hear their thots and see their latest progress on the subject  
it would be very wasteful to have twozero mil people on screen at one time a game like star citizen really needs to just put work on what you see because theres way too much to do 
only twod games or a tiny play ground threed game doesnt need to worry about optimizing
have you heard of the high elves
any news from the other provinces
yup the immersion breaks as soon as you hear a repeated conversation or line
i used to be an adventurer like you
there there anders everything happens for a reason it does
id rather have npcs meet up and actually talk tho
i wouldnt mind having a few extra gb of sound files for conversations and cig certainly would have no problem finding a few hundred voice actors willing to record 
shhhh cr might hear you
i asked for orange it gave me lemonlime 
how would you suggest they handle the situations where there are only a few people around
so they had background hum instead of actual conversations but never bothered to have different levels of it for different population densities
what is bdo
i know exactly what you mean now i know why i always felt uneasy in the villages yikes
uh stop lying bdo has the most npcs of any mmo ever in cities its like assassinc creed levels
blow off choffer 
doesnt get any better
while i agree deus ex is some what linear in the sense of story progression  youre usually not revisiting old areas and when you do its a new set  now imagine it in an mmo where you will visit the same locations on a regular basis  youre going to be hearing the same conversations hundreds of times  having a good variety of crowd noises and murmuring would work a lot better in the long run
denny crane
people would just translate it
immersive and adaptive are each on their own incredible endeavors 
the amount of source material to maintain immersion increases geometrically with the scale of the game itself  repeating voices repeating lines etc all break immersion and the more entities in a game the more assets required to avoid repetition
and even in a game that would take place entirely in one room with two voice actors it would take a very large pool of lines and phrases that could be strung together to create a short coherent conversation
put the two together and they build upon one anothers requirements adaptive dialogue that is also immersive must not only be coherent and not noticeably repetitive but several different takes must be made for each line delivered across a variety of inflections and emotional states so that the emotional state of the entity itself is consistent and contextually relevant to its situation
now add a third party to the conversation and double all your work over again 
even if they had the resources to create all the assets the sheer size of the files would be prohibitively large it would have to be housed serverside and the lines processed and delivered over the networkwhich would mean youre essentially downloading an mpthree file or several if youre in a crowded room at all times while playing in a populated area which would create all sorts of realworld issues with bandwidth and data caps
it just cant happen yet this is still one of those areas where a studio no matter how wellfunded has to decide which shortcut its going to take 
voice acting is one of the hardest things to bring to scale and one of the worst budget killers
im shook
theyre working on a lot of stuff programming takes a lot of time im sure it just hasnt been prioritised over some of the many other important things to put in the game no big deal its just a big project with limited resources 
i think even those are going to be generated based on the situation so if you are sitting at port olisar watching activity and crusader gets shipments of raw materials from four different places along trade routes and ships out to two others than the system will generate cargo ships coming and going with those materials to represent that
this is a really interesting topic to me too and i hope they do another atv about it soon
no thats not what they meant there are billions of potential npcs in sc but with a population of one million players operating at one time the amount of npcs operating in the instances with players would be twozero million  there would be no running modeled npcs in regions with no players they would be pure data and thats all
did i see you talking to sven
i used to be an adventurer like you
i was expecting something like and then i took an aurora to the knee 
i dont know how cd projekt red did it but boy howdy that game has so many hours of recorded lines in the witcher three cig needs to figure it out and replicate it 
and then they will need to do it again if they decide that fidelity n stuff and want to localize all the voice acted dialog as aswell when they localize 
sarcastically stating impossible tasks summons him
while fun thats not what i mean p i meant creating a conversation system that could pass a turing test
well either they say the same lines over and over again which will happen even if they record a ton of random dialogue or they just talk a different language 
well it was like a pretty realistic background chatter of a town square and yeah it was kind of placed on npcs but it just feels really bad in practice because the sound effect itself has location based sound so you place that on npcs vicinity and it still sounds like someone in the bushes is talking as opposed to the npc thats supposed to sound like plus none of them are actually talking with animations
they do
black desert online
im not lying i didnt mean a city has only onetwo npcs i just meant in the specific area i was in this is what happened to me in the game 
ive been better
freelancer one dash one you are cleared to land
top five show ever
what i mean is that even if the xian text means something youre unlikely to be as much bothered by it being repetitive as you would be if it were english
data caps what are those
was more agreeing with upieisbetter that in a simulation things arent real or even exist in memory until it is required to save on performance
itll probably be an algorithm instead of data but yes they would only exist or be generated on the fly if you are closelooked at them in game
thats the one xd
hi im commander shepherd and this is my favorite comment on the citadel
and then i drove a starfarer into their knees
helpim dyingof poverty
youll choke on three pounds of steel
and the most notorious example those two guards in velen who say the same damn thing every time you ride by themwhich is a lot
got their arses whipped like a novigrad whore
not to mention all of geralts repeated oneliners
winds howling
medallions humming
damn youre ugly
how do you like that silver
cmon roach
and so on
dont get me wrong the witcher three is my favorite game of all time and the amount of conversational audio recorded for that game is beyond bonkersbut its incidental audio isnt notably less repetitive than other games
its really easy if the company is willing to devote the time and money for voice actors to record those lines
youre right they need to begin by working on the voice acting pipeline not the recording itself 
i would think it would be cool to hear a mix of all languages it would add to the immersion imo
i bet star citizen wont solve pnp our ships should be safe with twofivesixbit aes encrypted voiceactivated locks
cr hold my beer
yeah i know i just couldnt resist d
that game has so many great lines and some of them are loved almost exclusively because they are so terrible haha
still have to be careful with the different language thing even if we dont know the words the cadence of the conversation is like a piece of music  well pick up on its melody and it will become as familiar and repetitive over time as a reused line spoken in our native tongue
maybe a few whisperedmumble conversations would work
i believe bd triggered that sound effect chatter when there was a large group of players in a town area thats why when there was alot of people standing around youd hear it if you went to an area in town with less players youd then no longer hear it it sounded wierd cause it wasnt at all smooth or subtle but i also find the npc repetitive scripted chat lines immersion ruining all do sometimes fun to quote id like to see maybe the background hum better implemented and then if possible more detailed conversation with a greater range of content or sentences procedurally generated id like to think this would be polish after major work do
yeah i thot i had voice on when i went into the tavern
im actually a little bit afraid of this  especially with video calls  im guessing subsumption will rotate atc workers on a schedule so you probably wont see and hear the same person constantly when you land at a specific port   but then how many voice file will be required to make every landing zone some what unique  itll be interesting to see how cig addresses this
why wont you diiiiiiiiie
yup the immersion breaks as soon as you hear a repeated conversation or line
correct me if im wrong but im pretty sure big nig shep didnt say hi in that dialogue
funny i loved oblivion and skyrim  couldnt put them down
played they maybe five of the witcher three and i just couldnt stay interested
dont know what it is i really enjoyed the second one but for some reason the third one beinf open world just felt more half arsed in its mission design mmo style go here fetch this kill x of this while i felt the second game was more story driven
yet skyrim was very much the latter like that too and it never really bothered me
agreed finding voice actors isnt a problem its just very time consuming to write hundreds of convos record edit and implement
mind you their writing team is pretty good from everything ive read and heard so if they sat down and took a month to write them up then it would make all the difference
boy i really sound like an armchair developer now
you gone done it now we get five more ship sales in a row to fund this haha
still way better than having in native tongue imo 
its just a little better than getting tired of the lines 
how about a combo  background hum but the closer you get to a group of npcs it turns into audible conversation  
ffxiv does something similar chatter in town and battlecries in large world events
works pretty well
but i also find the npc repetitive scripted chat lines immersion ruining 
i have a container if you have this you can put sotrage in your hoouwse  amergio heidal storage keeper
the only character ive ever heard say i have a container and make it sound creepy as hell
what if cig updates the voices every once in a while lets say every week or maybe month the same voice actor is hired then they record some lines with a slightly variated line perhaps sometimes with a pun added to it instead of stacking the new sound files they just get updated thus the old ones will never ever be heard again in the game
same here witcher just felt so damn corny  dont care for over shoulder cam either
played a few dozen hours of witcher three because of its well crafted and immersive lore as well as the amazing graphics gameplay scenario rpgcharacter management combat and so on were all better in skyrim but them i have been playing with requiem for so long that i may not be able to compare the two games fairly
that and the fact that actors are a huge budget to consider
procedural conversation
storage in your hows
thats a massive waste of perfectly usable sound files and enormously expensive if you think about it theyd have to do that for every landing zone and as we already know there even might be a good number on a planet like arccorp ditching the old ones ones that most people wont even have heard by then is just a waste of time and money
it was claimed as a technical limitation of redengine three altho i think that cd projekt red just didnt want to do it and didnt want to listen to people beg for it since their engine is proprietary there is no one who can macgyver it at home in redengine and prove them wrong
combat in skyrim definitely isnt better than the witcher three
maybe source them from the community of backers
pronversation
bleepbloop im a bot this portmanteauenwikipediaorgwikiportmanteau  was created from the phrase procedural conversation
shhhh youll add a year to development with statements like that
of course its expensive but dont buy an expensive car if you cannot afford it right also this might be positive for economics and employment in real life eg a student working parttime as voiceactor also you might think of a system that keeps count how many times a sound file has been played if it does not bypass some threshold then dont update that file you might stack up sound files in a repository if the count rarely bypasses the threshold when your inventory of sound files is high you save expenses on the voiceactors this might not be the best or worst solution it has some drawbacks what if that voiceactor dies should he die ingame too is this even ethically responsible but i think there are many solutions to keep the immersive there
random people will blow your mind at how bad they can be at things all the time tho  voice acting is a real skill
procedural vocabulary
this bot seems pretty useless
bad bot
it wouldnt surprise me if the majority of reddit comments are now made up of shitty bots which is particularly funny when a post related to botspam is currently stickied
thats true i would have thot thered be a fair few stage actors among the backers amateur or otherwise that could do a decent eno job cant be worse than some of the voice acting in skyrim or mass effect
another idea would be to have some of the ambient chatter in nonenglish it would make the universe more realistic whilst masking bad actinglines
