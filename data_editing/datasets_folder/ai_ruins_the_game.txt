I’m not sure how anyone could defend this but what the OP is doing is a very normal thing to do in a game. Hold an angle behind cover. AI with instant head eyes reaction after a sprint is just bad AI.
Don't you know you gotta follow a guide to perfection to deal with the rouges and not make a single mistake /s
This rogue had not engaged me from here before. He shot me at the front entrance and after rotating left to this position, he tracked me the whole time and instantly kills me.
If only BSG would install the SAIN mod on their servers.
BSG: we dont like the fact people can farm the rogues and bosses so we made them ridiculous hard

\*Makes it so there is only 1 viable way to kill any boss\*
Let me guess
M855 head eye
Honestly give me double the amount of ai that spray on me but turn their aim shit and i would have a blast
nikita accidentally balanced AI around players with esp/aimbot uh ohh 😯
Worst AI in modern games fr fr 💀
It’s not just the AI that’s ruining the events, I must of died 15 times on shoreline trying to kill 1 goon, half of those deaths felt like a cheater, instantly knew my position, instant head eyes
spt players living the dream with custom ai and event features
If the cheaters don’t get you the net code will.  If the net code doesn’t get you the audio will.  If the audio doesn’t get you then the AI will. 

There are a lot of things that work against this game being consistently fun and it makes me sad because I want to enjoy this game the way I once did but it doesn’t look like it’s in the cards any time soon.  Maybe in a few years.
It's true. Cheaters never made me actually quit a wipe, but the 3rd ridiculous death to Killa or Sanitair - after farming their maps for an entire weekend - just breaks my spirit beyond repair. 

This wipe the rogues broke me because they had to dial up the fuck you for no reason
Yeah - not only do the AI fire double bullets, they basically cheat - this is in the absence of BSG being able to develop any type of smart AI.

I'm all for the odd AI scav being cracked and doming me - that's more in line with what you can expect from other players - but having bosses that basically cheat isn't fun or challenging, it's just bullshit.  If the only reliable way to fight them is to lean through a slot in a door and shoot them with penetrating ammo - shit's broken.  It's the reason I haven't once loaded into lighthouse this wipe, and generally why I avoid a lot of the quests, because it's not worth the frustration of the game effectively cheating and the developers backing that up with 'it's supposed to be hard'.

Back when I would do the quests, the amount of time I'd spend blasting Sanitar in the head with ammunition that would render his head a hollow stump on a neck at best only to have him stand there because 'he's on drugs' and destroy me is why I don't really give a shit about a lot of the main quest line because in the absence of proper game dev, the game just cheats and turns what should be a challenge into a situation of RNG.
I dont even know why they bother banning cheaters if they just let the ai be in the game like this.
Started playing recently and hoooly shit the AI is absolutely cracked now. I'm level 20 and getting 10 deaths in a row. I'm staying to night time raids from now on and full rat mode.
I think that first shot ricocheted.  Double whammy.
maximum cheese was not employed
Does the AI de aggro? Because they track you through objects and bullets are whizzing by. Or you gotta run like 200m+ away from them to de aggro?
If you got killed like that and it was a player not an AI you'd 100% call hacks shows how broken they are lmao
The ai in this game is broken. Don't try to fight it "normally".
If you're spotted by a raider or rogue, fuck off for a while and come back. 

Otherwise they will do this. They've been doing it since they were added to the game, and will continue to do so. 

It's just one of those Tarkov things and imo won't be changing anytime soon.
The sub is filled daily with video proof of horrible, horrible AI. Has it even been acknowledged by the devs? Why isn't it top priority along with desync?
I’ve missed this game. Thank you for bringing me back to reality before I pick it up again!
Ai is horrible hopefully they can make some changes soon
Wont ever be fixed my man :) gotta learn to deal with the shitty game design
Do we prefer a John wick ai? No

What ai do we want? Stormtrooper ai xD
Other than not following the "guide" or "rules" to dealing with them, you ain't even do anything wrong lmao. It's tragic
Fucking ridiculous that we have to deal with hackers and aimbotting AI.
honestly man, it pisses me off that AI is almost perfectly accurate while side strafing. If players try that, their PMC swings his gun to the side slow as hell and the sights go off by a mile. If a scav does that, they can reliably hit shows at 30 meters. Complete bullshit.

AI rework can't come fast enough.
Yeah shoreline event is atrocious because the AI is ridiculous
Pvp ruins the game and the events :). I dont see fucking ai rats hiding with flirs on each corner possible. Oh wait, I see them, they called cultists
agreed
I don't even bother going there at daytime
this is why i bailed on this shitshow lol
you just got rolled bro
HOW IS THIS BAD AI YOU PEOPLE ARE SO THICK
Yerp you just learned never to pvp ai with corner peaks. Let them rush you in a room and hip fire their face. Or nade them and get them as they move.
I get that AI is bad but you can’t expect ex PMCs to miss as much as a drunk hobo
Skill issue
Git gud
the ai will never be good so get used to it
Yea this isn’t great but you guys act like there’s EVER been “good” AI in a multiplayer FPS game lol. It does not exist. 

You really think tarkov will be the game to revolutionize AI? You’re not some genius for thinking this AI isn’t “fair” it’s obvious. But i would rather them be stupid hard than easy like every other AI in existence. Makes the game fun. I can see how your average dad with 100 hours would hate this, but just don’t engage bosses when you know they’re there if you can’t kill them properly.
Be better
"How dare they make Tarkov hard I wanna feel powerful like in easy games grrrr"
Git gud
Well you are trying to do the task during the day so whee we t did you expect
Have you tried upgrading your gamer chair?
i mean a player could have done the same to you idk this clip is not even bad
What events?
Goons are terrible for the random 480 noscope
i haven’t been on in a while so i’m out of the loop, what event (if any) is going on? i heard we’re close to wipe, or is everyone joking still? i know a roadmap was dropped not too long ago when i still had twitter
Yea I got wallbanged by them behind the blue fence. I was in complete cover. They headshotted me through it. It's annoying they are so broken.
Yeah I was wondering why everytime I heard a scav say a voice line I immediately get 1 tapped…
I've had AI just stand and stare at a wall while I just walked up to them and other times get sit in my stomach thru a bush multiple times
get a better gaming chair bro
First time playing Tarkov ?
I gotta love the fact when rouges dont one tap you in the head instantly their 5.56 fmj magically goes through my fucking hexgrid in 2 shots
The bosses, rouges and raiders all need tuning down, these “special tactics” people preach aren’t intentional game design it’s a work around a broken system. “Just flash bang Killa and he will run out” that shouldn’t be the only strat because it’s the only way to avoid his laser beam aim. Give him more health and make him charge you or take up a defensive position, don’t just making him an aim bot to anyone he see’s. Only time my friend has killed him was when he barrel stuffed himself in a doorway and before that he nearly killed me in half a second. The bosses used to be fun but now they are just irritating. I’ve had the goons shoot me from weather station all the way out past the radio tower, now that would be understandable if it was just Bird Eye doing it, but having grenade launcher rounds land near by and being full auto sprayed is just not fun.
"working as intended" - nikita, probably
I’ve really never have issues with Ai it players more for me
Don't you just love how hardcore this game is 🤓
Bird eye on shoreline is so broken, BSG is so incompetent they can’t even do the most basic things right. It is truly astonishing…
Lighthouse has consistently been my worst experience with the AI. It’s either rogues shooting from 400m away or regular scavs one tapping me through layers of brush with no line of sight, which is a consistent issue I’ve found across every map but lighthouse seems for frequent.
From my understanding of the AI. Once you agro them from an angle, they are hyper fixated in that line of sight for roughly 10-15 seconds.

Similar to how we "slice the pie" ingame. You held a GOOD position, but because they were still fixated on that spot from what I can only assume is a prior peek not shown in the video. They were already pre-aimed and when your pixel registered for the Ai... *Head, eyes*
My boi ran you down like he was listening to freebird and it just hit the Guitar solo.
Imagine if the ai was 75% as good as division… it’s not the #1 issue with the game but it’s easily top 5… in a game with bosses and harder ai that drops actual cool loot but the fights with them are just so bad.
I catch myself  standing in one spot shooting  for to long  all the time. I'm not saying that's what happened.  You got tarkoved just pop one or two shots sometimes  and move quickly  repositioning  a lot wins me a lot of fights. For anyone  new sound is op in tarkov  but u can sneak around more then u think  there are a lot of sounds that you hear as loud  but other player's can't hear.  Good luck  everyone  wipe is almost here.
At least you saw him.  They’ve been beaming me through the wooden fence
Full speed sideways strafe head eyes while getting shot. Yep as realistic as playable.
Or don't be trash 🗑️
“Experienced and combat trained personnel”
Whats new
So what now, bot games are harder then human games?
Get good
It’s just stupid. But the fanboys will find a way to defend it
"Skill issue"
What you don't have fun getting insta aimbotted by rogues and turbo scavs? 

First time I played lighthouse me and my buddy ran into one of the lodged on the beach, looted a sports bag and instantly the automatic grenade launcher scav from like 4-5 hundred meters away or however far slams a grenade right through the window killing us both.

It's not fun dying to cheating AI it's just a frustrating waste of time.
On Shoreline, Birdeye shot one shot me on first shot from cottages while I was standing at tunnel…. So apparently AI can shoot/see me halfway across the map. I never went near cottages, never fired at goons, and this shit happens. Makes me not wanna play the game
Escape from tha 💩 tarkov.
The inconsistent AI is the worst part. I can fuck around in the open by a scav or boss, n they do nothing but miss

I hold an angle and they instantly head eyes me every time
The rouges are too powerful man
I havent played in a month what events are people talking about?
No what ruins the events is putting shit In labs where every time I go in I die to a cheater
Agreed. Ai way way overtuned
What's the problem? This is just normal Tarkov gameplay.
players do the same thing
Damn
SPT for the win
When a player does this, it is considered what? Outplayed?
The safer thing to do is not hold the angle but stay behind cover and jiggle peak once the AI has moved into position then shoot.. it’s not rocket science.
On lighthouse its fucking stupid but yeah you gotta follow the guide
How are people STILL typing rouge instead of rogue holy shit
We should have developers of the game do it and if they can’t get it in a singular try and extract  this should be changed. Thoughts?
So why didn't you just run up the side fence and heal behind the container whilst letting him deaggro? I have no idea why you're trying to ego peak an AI that's aggro'd and pushing you through bushes whilst both your arms are blacked, deserved death TBH.
Its not like its hard too, i mean unpaid dudes doing that in their free time did it, why not a game company?
what does the SAIN mod do?
Out of ignorance.. what is that one way? Doors?
Blacked via arms
5.56 FMJ head, eyes for me. I shot a rogue 3 times in the back before he instant 360’d me with head eyes smh.
Exactly. AI should mainly be there to alert players to your position.
Actually that kinda adds up.. if a player has ESP and is gonna cheese a boss or AI… fuck it level the playing field and pray the cheater gets smoked fast AF lol.. I’d love that
please share the list of multiplayer fps with good AI, I'd like to play it.
There are def a lot of cheaters still idk how it could even be debated
Doing those shoreline terra group task were helllllll, with the cheaters.
Bro 15? I swear I died twice that for the goddamn goon kill… because so many fucking players were killing ME instead of the goons like BRO JUST LET ME LIVE I DONT EVEN SEE YOU RN I JUST NEED THE KILL 😭
Hahaha I got it done in 2 tries only reason I needed a second attempt is bc they were already dead the first time I showed up. There’s cheaters but it’s not every raid I promise you that
It's not cheaters dude it's just late wipe so everyone has thermals. I have 10 flir 5 repair in my stash and I only play on weekends
You know we are, i got a mod where ai is not capable of seeing through bushes and recoil is actually existent to the rouges and scav bosses and basically every prewipe event that adds extra ai(Totaly not trying to get people to use spt)
> Maybe in a few years.

I thought that in 2017 and come back regularly, but there is no point having hope, you will only get frustrated.   
The game is stuck in eternal development, because the management is either absolutely incompetent or just doesn't care anymore, since coasting on marketing during this FPS market drought is good enough.
NEVERMIND, I got insta prefired twice by a cheater oh boy this game :DD
not cracked, just bad.
AI isnt that cracked.. Just don't look at htem for more than a few seconds.
If you are fighting the goons they dont once they see you they can see you throughout the rest of the raid even through walls even while like 300 meters away and for most ai it takes like 5-10 mins or you gotta be shooting them from like 300m away
Ikr
Agree, it's crazy how many people have skill issue. AI in EFT is the same for a long time, such a strange thing to be amazed by that every time. Just play the game, learn how AI works and play around it. What do these people want, stormtroopers? 

Sometimes you are not the protagonist. I got headeyesed by a rogue with M4 from 300 meter away on lighthouse, why would I come to reddit to cry if it's a common thing
Only reason I follow this sub anymore. Every time I feel like jumping back into the game, I come to this sub for 10-15 minutes and that feeling fades almost immediately.
They changed the scavs, did absolutely nothing
Bsg: “we dont like how people are farming the rouges for high tier loot so lets make it where you get killed unless you follow a specific YouTube video and have the rouges not spawn with anything above 5.56 so farming them is pointless and lets have it to where you have to clear this camp to get to half of your quests”
Nikita said multiple times that its because they are “highly trained operators” like dude so are our pmcs, we are quite literally the same

Naked scav eyes are already flirs.
This shouldn't be something you should have to fucking learn or adapt to, the AI should just not be dogshit and literally cheating — OP did nothing wrong.
Pvp ai?
"Properly"

He held a good angle and got shots on target. This is literally text book properly and the stupid gamey cheesy shit way to kill AI shouldn't be "proper".
its not hard. it's just that you have to cheese everything past ai scavs. That's not fun, it's poor, lazy design.
Why should players have to follow very specific guidelines for this shit exactly ?
Even at night it's not much better, you can still get cracked by big pipes MCX from 300m.
Whenever in game events happen there’s usually ai and most if the time said ai as good enough aim to split a hair in half from 500 meters away at full auto
Wipe is happening within august(prolly late august)

Current event has you go to shoreline and have you do things for fence about collecting something (i think a stim of some kind)from a scav that was working for fence and got ambushed by lightkeeper on his way back and if you do the quest you expand your stash(it could be permanently) and you can unlock lightkeeper instead of completing every quest in the game. 

This is the 4th prewipe event we have had and its full of lore if ur into that part of the game, also whenever a prewipe event ends another one begins

And the roadmap just shows future plans for the game but doesn’t tell us dates, all it says what they are working on
Dude if i see a scav flip me off, go prone, or say a specific voiceline, i get one tapped by magnum buck from 50 meters away
when player does that, its skill. Because we are not calculated artificial intelligence, it requires fair amount of luck as well.
No, usually its desync  lol
Exactly so the ai outplayed them
The point is that it shouldn’t be the norm for this game homie
Jiggle peak is not a solution it’s just abusing an already busted AI. This should not be the case to attack AI. 

Bobblehead PMCs is not the answer. It’s not rocket science.
Thats not how a game should work.

Its completely counter intuitive. Abusing a dogshit AI is not gameplay.

He held a corner and waited for the target to walk into his line of fire and died instantly.
How can you actually defend the AI when the ONLY way to kill it is to abuse the in game mechanics in unintended ways? The AI is supposed to simulate real people but the way you fight them is in no way similar to how you would fight real people.
I’ve found night time to be way more pleasant, bots have reduced sight, far less likely to get domed 200 meters away because a gunner saw your one pixel peeking around a corner
Its red it after all...
Don't worry, it'll be rouge soon. Same as aluminium became aluminum
They don't play the game there's my thoughts.
Ego peak? What? Dude, I'm holding an angle on something that should be looking straight forward and not tracking me perfectly through a wall. I never shot him or saw him from that angle prior to getting killed, so what are you on about? You actually want to know how he blacked my arms?! He spotted and agroed me THROUGH THE TENT WITH THE BTR UNDER IT! NOT OVER NOT UNDER, THROUGH THE TENT, NO LOS AND HE SHOT MY ARMS OFF! But yeah its just a skill issue, like my goodness you braindead idiot, what is wrong with you?!
God you're so arrogant it hurts
"YoU sHoUlD Do A 360 NoScOpE DeAgGrO It WaS oBvIoUs Ai WoUlD KiLl YoU DeSeRvEd" 🤓   


lmao imagine defending shitty game mechanic because you are used to it
OP is pointing out that it’s un-fun that the AI enemies with almost twice as much HP as player characters & an ability to fire 3 bullets at once with pinpoint accuracy at enemies who’ve changed position can do so while strafing, pointfiring, and being shot. Of course there’s a way to run behind something and sit there for 90s until the robot forgets you were ever there and you start over, but is it too much to ask that the AI could just fuckin’ work? 

Sure, programming AI is hard, but reducing their health pools to be equal with players or perhaps EVER fixing the three-bullets-per-trigger-pull bug would be a good start. 

The AI in this game is one of the worst things about it, only navigable by following some mumbling dumbfuck’s YouTube guide on exactly where & how to cheese each particular Rogue/Boss on any given map, and BSG insists on adding more and more of these half-baked raid-enders -all the time.
The choices made by OP doesn’t justify AI being able to 100% accuracy a previously unknown player whilst strafing
Why are you acting like AI should be able to instantly head eyes someone ????
Go back to snorting pills degenerate.
has a flipping grizzly too
Stop defending shit programming. Just stop.
because they drink vodka with orange juice during their working time, they also showed that on stream.
Makes the AI play more like real people. Let's use this video as a baseline. With SAIN that AI would have had a random "personality" assigned to it. 

With a more aggressive personality he'd have his Nikes laced up ready to bum rush you. He would probably run up a bit closer and lean-peek you. Hell, they could even jump from around the corner after you. Ever seen an AI jump?

With a more passive personality it would have either waited for a chance to ambush you, waiting for you to get close before either blind-firing your direction or be pre-emptively holding the angle in cover. or just straight up ran away.

Truly anything is better than AI walking toward you sideways and insta headshotting you. But kicking you in the balls is just BSG's style.
Makes the game better. Still not perfect though. Just general ai improvements.
Sniping them from far away, right hand peeking specific angles, doors when inside. That's about it. 

Any regular 1v1 is a death sentence unles you legit hit a god tier first bullet headshot.
There’s a couple ways but they’re all really “cheese” strategies. Usually throwing a base near them will trigger a sprint and a voice line, and while they sprint they’re basically incapable of fighting. Other strat is doors, or holding crazy angles.
Nah look at his health top corner. When you are hit in blacked limb you can see the whole body turning red and more red with every bullet until you are dead
Im totally fine with them being a legitimate threat, just... not via aimbot.
Yep, Hunt Showdown does this very well and it works great.
They should just be there imho. No guns or anything, just be there.
Division 2 AI was actually decent for being a multiplayer game tbh.
S.T.A.L.K.E.R AI has pretty good moments.   


But besides those good moments, they'll sit at a campfire and eat 3 headshots while continuing to play their guitar.
Bad AI because it is too weak >>> Bad AI because it is too strong in a multiplayer game. There are always other players to present a serious threat, no game needs random autodeaths
SPT (Single player tarkov) paired with the SAIN mod makes AI actually fair
Most modern games have good AI, honestly. The thing about good AI is that you don't notice it until it's not there.
Yeah it’s got to be around 15, an issue with the skills for sure, fighting them in the daylight is ridiculous and my night raids were packed with players with thermals. I have one of those DSF flares so I’m going to try and assemble a small team and try and do it that way.
Weirdly I killed big pipe and bird eye on my first try but it didn’t count because I hadn’t completed the first part of the quest where you have to get close to the cottages. I got 50 million to spend so I’m just going to keep going.
You need to see "Goats" video if you don't believe it's cheaters.
Sounds like you’re joking but I legitimately have 5-6 FLIRs and have killed several people around cottage with them already. It definitely feels like hacking when you have an absurd vision advantage.

Number of FLIRs also doesn’t matter when you can straight up buy them from jaeger.
What are those two mods called?
name of mods?
loved the 3.6.0 update with gift codes, and I genuinely can't wait to mod some into the game
How difficult is it to fight scavs relative to normal Tarkov?
Oh, don't get me wrong, I have no hope anymore.  My last ember of hope was snuffed out during the Halloween event 2 years ago?  I think it was 2 years ago.  Remember the "be online!  amazing things are going to happen!!"  Then we're all sitting there for an hour, waiting, when eventually the "big event" takes place, day turns to night, it gets foggier so sniping is 100% off the table and scavs have pumpkin heads again.  Then there were some mutterings about how more was planned blah blah blah.  It's at that moment that I thought to myself that I have to let go of caring about the fate of Tarkov.  If it gets fixed, great, I'll happily play again.  If it doesn't?  Well, we'll just get more clown shows like Streets.  The most hyped FPS map of all time that landed with a wet flop.  Unplayable to almost everyone, rubber banding that the Michelin Man would be envious of, huge buildings with 3 rooms each that you can enter.  

It's all just.... whatever... I don't even know.  When you have devs showing up to live streams drunk or high or both, then taking a break mid stream while freaking out because the demos are all going badly to have "juice time" (which they've made a special graphic for btw, who makes a special graphic for a break [who has breaks during live streams??] in a live stream to go drink more) you know that the wings are off the plane and they're just riding that metal tube into the ground.
Might not be cheaters right now, a lot of thermals at night
I was standing on the hill by the truck on shoreline to the left of resort.

The goons tried to beam me from cottage through trees about 500+m away while I was looking in the opposite direction of them. What was my mistake? Existing on the same map? Neither of us had line of sight.
Imagine defending the busted AI this hard.
Hahahaha don’t look at the enemy great one
Sorry people don’t understand sarcasm.
just hold your gun behind your head and kill them with a no-look shot 🙄
That sucks
except now they see straight through bushes and trees and from miles away. Shits straight up broken.
Good bot.
He meant don’t fight AI like you fight people. “You don’t PVP AI”.
So what would you fix here? The AI should not shoot? Or miss you? Or take longer to find him as a target? 

I’m what way exactly do you change the AI behavior in this scenario without making them too easy to kill?
Idk. The AI is dogshit busted, I agree, but as to why players SHOULD, you're sneaking into a defended military outpost of ex-USECS. Why shouldn't you have to be careful?
thanks big man. really appreciate it. fuck i may have to do that for phat stash expansion. i have eod, do we know if the expansion is still worth it?
They have human function so idk what you mean 🤷
The AI can consistently, near 100% of the time, beam you in the face with a shitty 40 durability trash mod AK, from any distance while moving. That’s not good AI. It’s not the AI outplaying us either, it’s replacing actually engaging AI with artificial difficulty of inhuman aim and reaction speeds.
What do you mean? The game is meant to be realistic clearly. I don't know about you but in my super classified navy seal airborne marine special forces training they taught us how to jigglepeak and bunny hop.
Not to mention he shot the ai first which would aimpunch players but ai doesn’t suffer from that so he just loses
The rogue was already agro'd from a previous peek not shown in the clip, was already fixated on that spot, and when the rogue pushed forward. It had essentially already had the Los lined up
bro at night time i was near the construction site and i have no clue how they saw me but the grenade launcher rogue obliterated me. i measured it, i think it was something like 231 metres. in nighttime.
Yeah, but you so much as pop a half chub IRL and every one of them in a mile radius can 360 no-scope you in the fucking retinas again.
Any time you take good quad NVGs and a 762 Nato gun to lighthouse, expect to be killed by a cheater.
Yeah i should bring in some flirs and see all what this is all about it you ahahsah wahdhf dg
Got shot trough a door crack yeasterday, head eyes. Fuck scopes iron sights for the win i guess
Rogue and rouge are two different words entirely, and are not exchangeable. Aluminum and aluminium are two different spellings, both correct and interchangeable.
[removed]
Where in any of what I said, did I defend BSG's coding? You completely illiterate 40iq child.

It's irrelevant how you think the games coding should work, it's been this way for years and the OP made an absolutely dogshit decision within the confines of how the game actually works.

Deserved. Downvote away, doesn't bother me in the slightest. OP played like shit and died.
[deleted]
You can think what you want about the AI and you could write a 140 page novella about the ways in which BSG could change it but that's all completely irrelevant.

This is how the AI works, this is how it's always worked, this is how it will continue to work. OP played like shit within the confines of the video game as it currently stands, regardless of how you think the game should work. 

If you need youtube guides to work out how to play the game that says it all. Try just actually playing and learning yourself instead of immediately seeking advice from others at the smallest sign of difficulty/challenge/uncertainty. 

Dying isn't a big deal in the slightest, learn from the mistake and adapt.
Yes but the ai also doesn't have guns lol. But that is the prise it should have.
Most modern shooters are either incredibly easy, have bullet sponge enemies, or rely on a streamlined trial-and-error system in single player or coop that allows you to retry the encounter within a few seconds of dying.

Completely different than Tarkov.
My man good shit
I have he doesn't use any kind of real statistical analysis, he's using a very small pool of anecdotal data and jumping to massive conclusions. I've played 4 wipes. My brother has Kappa. Between me and him we've got 9000 hours. We both have seen and or been killed by less than 10 blatant cheaters all wipe. That doesn't mean cheaters don't exist because that's just my anecdotal experience. But the idea that 60% of games have a cheater is patently absurd.


Yes cheaters are out there. But the ones that kill other players are almost ALWAYS blatantly cheating like they fly around the map etc. I've been killed by 3 blatant cheaters all wipe. 1 was named BanMePlz69 and literally was invisible and could fly. The other was a guy on factory who killed me after I had ratted silently in one spot for 15 minutes and he shot me through a wall. I added him and he asked if I wanted a carry that's how blatant he was. And both of them got banned. My brother has ran into 3-5 of the blatantly cheating flying guys and he has Kappa this wipe. 


The RMT chinese farmers that use hacks to farm for rmt play exclusively on west for the most part, and BSG's efforts to limit RMT have significantly hurt RMT.


Cheaters were a much bigger problem last wipe, and the wipe before that. There was so much RMT farming going on I know because I met cheaters through the official discord and they usually were using it to farm RMT or farm carrys.
the ai mod is called SAIN's
SAIN's for the ai
I just got prefired in a secluded corner in shoreline where the village is(not the sanitar one)while afk for like 15 mins watching a video and dude storms in doesnt check any corners besides the one im in and starts shooting before i even see his shoulder come around the corner
Well you seen, you used your third eye and you should have made it blind.
That is exactly what I was going for, good job. Yes, you did it.  wait
Have them not lock on for one thing, you can also adjust their accuracy, or time it takes to acquire target. Lots of things. The single player mod tarkov people have many mods that mess with ai and provide a MUCH better experience.
Sounds like you are lacking the AI skill
Yeah, I was an Arctic seal. It's kind of like navy seals but cooler and makes funny noises. We learned to take 5 stimulants and be drugged out all the time rubbing lip balm on my face and bunny hopping across door ways to peak my enemies
I know WHY it happened. 

Im saying it should not happen because its dogshit gameplay.
Rogue AI doesn’t get reduced vision as it gets darker. It is binary, they either have full vision or have their reduced night vision, nothing in between. 21:45 ￼— 05:00 they cannot see you at construction, you just werent there at what the rogues consider “night”.

I think they increased his range because I remember he didn't shoot unless you were closer to the beach last wipe but this wipe I've been killed close to the construction site by the grenade launcher.
Soon they won't be, don't worry
gotta love a 'realistic tactical shooter' where holding an angle against a sprinting opponent is 'F-' level play
You're full of it.

What the hell is an "ego peak" anyway?
They hated him because he was right
You mad
You probably got to level 30 and decided to become an expert
Honestly you have a fair point, the guide makers put in the work & without them you’d have no choice but to die to 1100HP laser aimbot AI again and again until you found whatever BS cheese works on them. I avoid AI bosses like the plague ‘cause I just don’t think they’re fun, but you’re right, somebody has to make those guides so that the content is more accessible.
The guy just said “it is how it is” lmao.    
Ima keep it real with you chief, it is completely irrelevant what **you** think about people complaining and giving feedback. On the contrary to yours “git gud”, the    
>140 page novella about the ways in which BSG could change it

Is very much relevant and valuable. If you didn’t notice yet we’re all here playing “closed” beta, and the first google search will tell you that *”Beta tests are used to identify any remaining bugs or usability issues and gather feedback on the overall user experience”*. So that feedback is very much needed. And if it’s too hard for you comprehend the idea of “giving feedback” or say anything besides “try actually playing”, then many people will kindly ask you to fuck right off as even the simplest “AI bad, pls fix” complaint brings more to the table than anything you wrote so far
yeah, if you need guides you should just go back and replay the tutorial
Timmies will downvote, but this death is deserved.
No, it's absolutely not different. Literally the only thing stopping Tarkov from being *exactly* what you described is the cranked up AI damage/aim and the multiplayer format.

> have bullet sponge enemies, or rely on a streamlined trial-and-error system

This is already the case though? Higher tier enemies difficulty comes entirely from arbitrarily buffed health pools and aim, plus the entire PVE gameplay loop is built around trial and error as you figure out how to exploit the AI.

None of this makes for good AI. It's just bandaids and artificial difficulty.
RMT is a subsection of cheaters but you have tons more people still offering carries, rage cheaters, and people who just cheat for the hell of it to get an advantage. Most people use radar but plenty of non-flying aimbotters as well.

Acting like the RMT changes cut cheating way down is just foolish and wrong.
> and literally was invisible and could fly.

If he was invisible, how did you know he was flying?
> Between me and him we've got 9000 hours. We both have seen and or been killed by less than 10 blatant cheaters all wipe.

haha
too many words... Sounds like cope
Bro typed a whole ESSAY like bro ain’t nobody got time to read all that shit!!
Okay, those are the blatant cheaters that are easy to detect and ban. How about all of the less obvious stuff, like ESP and radars? Or how about the people who selectively use aimbot?
I agree with both of you. It just needs some better fine tune accuracy. But a rogue should not be as easy as a scav. Did OP say they were already engaged prior? Big no no. If you get engaged you have to wait for them to deaggro or you will get fucked no matter what.
Much better but also much “easier” yea? The fixes you speak of, taking longer to acquire the target, not “locking on” and adjusting their accuracy AKA make them miss more shots. These are all things that make the AI just plain easier to defeat, which is not their goal and basically loot Piñatas. More fun for some but not for others… 

The idea, like most things in Tarkov, is much easier said than done. Actually making the AI more fun to fight but not compromising their difficulty is insanely hard to accomplish. Same argument as “Fix spawns we are too close!” It’s just so much easier on paper than realistically fixing. 

So you’re not wrong in saying it needs fixed… but you’re wrong for thinking it’s some easy issue with simple solutions like you named. Much more complicated.
You're absolutely correct. 

I'll take this advice and go about making sure I have the same capabilities as the AI. 

Anybody know how I can go about getting 0 weapon sway, 0 recoil, extrasensory perception so that I can track players through though solid objects on the other side of the map, and the ability to lock my aim to specific body parts?
Honestly the AI should have an idea of where is at if he was already aggro'd they just need to tune down their accuracy a tiny bit. Their's a mod for offline that does this wonderfully but I can't remember what it's called.
Oh, it plays terribly, no disputing that. For the time being, all we can do is cheese or flip a coin.

I did see on the updated roadmap for Ai improvements in the August wipe. So hopefully something comes of that
yeah probably was between like 19:00. still dark as piss but not nighttime apparently 😂
Ive seen people get grenade lauchered all the way at Informant’s beachhouse. Absolutely ridiculous
Why won't they be? What is your reasoning for thinking this?
Your mistake was in thinking that Tarkov is remotely realistic or a tactical shooter. It's a hardcore looter shooter filled with gameisms, the only thing it has in relation to real life is the gun parts/names.
ego peak is a very common term in fps games and is actually extremely self explanatory if you use your brain.
Guy who doesn't even know what an ego peak is tries to discuss nuances of an FPS game.

100% reddit.
Ikr the keyboard warrior over here lol
Fucking Cultists dude.. I’ve hunted Bloodhounds, Sanitar and his guards, Reshala and his Guards, and Shturman and his Guards but I’ll be fuckin damned if I could ever kill a fucking cultist. Impossible (pretty much) to see on thermals, they literally rat in the hardest to see places, run fucking fast, have night vision, are silent, and are as skilled as a Rogue or Bloodhound. Like FUCK cultists dude…
Yeah all us who played the game for years before there even existed a wiki or guides at all just gave up and didn't play till some lord and savior streamer came and saved us.

Critical thinking is dead. Long live blind obedience.
> Higher tier enemies difficulty comes entirely from arbitrarily buffed health pools

They're far from being bullet sponges, even a juiced up Sanitar will die in one hit from a shotgun.

> as you figure out how to exploit the AI.

But even once you figure out how to exploit it, a lot of the time you have to sort of tip-toe around the encounter while doing w/e is required for the cheese. All while other players are likely also trying to kill the boss. That's what leads to some of the most intense and hilarious moments in Tarkov.

It's not good AI, but it does drive players towards the type of game situations that are seemingly exactly what BSG wants. And it's fun, which is why we all keep coming back to the game wipe after wipe. I don't think Tarkov is a case either of being "fun *except* for the darn AI"! I think the jankiness and ridiculous threat levels that can come from the AI adds to the game in a weird way.
I agree . I think most people that cheat do it because they don't like losing.
Because we could see tracers flying from a spot in the sky at us following us through the air all the way down shoreline beach
>I can't read
How melted is your attention span that two paragraphs are too much for you to read? Fucking zoomers, man.
Reading words is indeed difficult
Who likes the way AI are right now? I'd rather it be too easy than be like it is now, you will always have players for difficulty as well 

And even then I really don't think it would be too easy. I'm a tarkov vet and have played alot of the game, got kappa etc. And even with that on the single player mod I still die and it still has some challenge.

Not to mention everything has just been nerfed and shit on to the point of being unfun. Raiders dropping shit ammo/shit gear/ shit broken guns. It wouldn't be as bad if tarkov didn't have such a dumb tiered system for effectiveness (like the realism mod) but it does.

I dunno. Just doesn't feel good all around
Hax, you're looking for hax.
if we're using piss as a darkness measurement perhaps a doctor's visit is in order
The earliest you want to start queuing up for nighthouse is 21:30, but if you have a quick load and a close spawn you can still get bonked by a rogue; so be careful there.
I got killed there just the other day
Your mistake is egocentric abuse of shared game knowledge.

You miss the point of this post. Bad AI is still bad AI - regardless of loophole mechanics.
an ego peek is putting yourself in a vulnerable situation where you know an enemy will probably be and engaging in a 50/50 duel. In CS "I'm gonna ego peek mid with an awp" is just busting out into the area and trying to snap onto a player and kill them, as opposed to working around the map playing angles and flanks.

Holding an angle behind cover on an AI is in no way an "ego peek" in any definition of the term.
Yes, the meaning is obvious.
I just don't like the term, especially when it's misused.
What an ego explaination lol
I love how 420prayit and 88vicodin spread their immense knowledge
>Guy who doesn't even know what an ego peak

Lol. It's a PEEK. You spelled it wrong like six times. An "ego peak" is nothing.
ahh, my favorite hiking spot, *Ego Peak*
I can surmise what it means, if that's what you're implying, I just don't see the applicability here.

Regardless though.
OP wasn't peaking, or " ego peaking" or whatever. He was holding an angle.
I don't need to be a Super CSGO Operator to tell the difference.

I reiterate my previous point.

You're full of it.
No. An ‘ego peek’ is you peeking heaven with AK when you know there’s an AWP there but want to try to get the kill anyways cuz he just domed two of your friends. Holding an angle in a tactical fps against AI is not an ‘ego peek’.
Bloodhounds are broken, too. I usually don't get killed by AI much since I cheese them and know the safe ways. But last night, my team spawned sunken on shoreline. Pushed up to go into the village to fight the goons. And I saw 4 things on thermal. I was almost 200m away, I believe. I went prone behind a big tree and right peaked and lined up a headshot. Before i could shoot I was dead.  9x19 PST.  Fucking pst from that far. 4 of them to the face
Im sorry life was so hard for you back in the day old timer

thanks for laying the ground work for all those guides so I didn’t have to waste tons of time figuring it out myself
Too many words again try harder bub
Ohhhhhhhh, ok. That makes sense.
He meant "dark ass piss" because when you piss from your ass its usually pretty dark.
> Regardless though. OP wasn't peaking, or " ego peaking" or whatever. He was holding an angle. I don't need to be a Super CSGO Operator to tell the difference.

This is correct in every community. Holding an angle is never considered an ego peek (or peak). Ego peeking would be what the AI did, running out unfavourable into someone holding an angle hopping to kill quick to survive. Then again that isn't even a peak but a full on run out lmao.
Only broken in the daytime. Nighttime at times they get sketchy for no reason but 90% of my experiences were eazy cheesing with a FLIR and medium range.
Thanks for being one of the guide following timmy's that are just a free kill every raid because they can't do a single thing for themselves except try and emulate what they see on youtube. 

Also I don't remember ever saying the game was hard at all but hey, you said it so it must be true, my mistake. I can see your reading comprehension skills are as adequate as your critical thinking ones, ignorance is bliss I suppose.
relax nerd
You are not a real person
I hope there are better days coming for you, buddy
